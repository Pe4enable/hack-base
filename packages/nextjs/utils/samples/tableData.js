However as is always the case nothing is perfect. Every model is biased and it is impossible to build mindblowing models in few hours. Furthermore labeling the data is the most time consuming and often iterative process. Here in this project we deploy the model for both users to explore the ecosystem but also help to better differentiate between the human and bot activities. We store the user contributions on-chain (Scroll Alpha testnet) and paying them the transaction. We think that this provides users incentives to  contribute to the ecosystem as it leaves permanent traces. Furthermore the user inspection is made easier by providing additional Token/NFT data from Ethereum Mainnet that was not used in the training of machine learning.

Why not make it a game? Users can fill slots on a board for 2 minutes and the computer within a semi-random 15 minute interval will select one of those entries on the board to get tokens. I plan to integrate social proof to avoid farming but for the hackathon sake we make users login to verify their wallet to receive funds and prevent users signing too many times.While many projects attempt to verify security and trust in a multisig and wallet environment this project turns this concept on its head: what if the wallet itself could do lots of random actions and users with no value in their wallets can submit proposed transactions such as getting some tokens or NFTs. Around every 5 minutes the server will pick a random square on the proposal grid and execute it through the user's chosen chain and wallet either directly on the chain or via the chain's multisig.The backend here uses gnosis safe SDK and multisigs to collect tokens then a simple forwarder address to submit transactions to the safe. If something happens to the forwarder assets are safe and can be recovered from another address associated with the safe to remove the forwarder's permission and fix the issues.Supported chains:Mumbai / PolygonGoerli / ETHGnosis ChainMantle This project uses a standard web front-end interface.

Here's an overview of our tech stack and how we put it all together:NFT Bridge: We utilized Taiko zkEVM and Polygon zkEVM as the backbone for our trustless ERC721 Open Access NFT Bridge. These Layer 2 solutions enable fast and secure cross-chain NFT transfers between Ethereum Taiko and Polygon providing the desired interoperability.Smart Contracts: We developed our smart contracts using Solidity a popular and versatile language for Ethereum-based applications. We employed Hardhat a powerful development environment for compiling deploying and testing our contracts ensuring their reliability and security.Frontend: To create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface we chose React Next.js TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. This combination of technologies allowed us to build a responsive modular and maintainable frontend that interacts seamlessly with our smart contracts and backend services.Backend: For our enhanced zkEVM backend with Merkle Proof Support we developed a Rust-based service to efficiently handle Merkle proof generation and validation. Rust's performance and safety features made it an ideal choice for this critical component.Sponsor Technologies: We integrated the @statechannels browser-based wallet to streamline the connection to Coinbase and Bitfinex APIs simplifying user onboarding and interaction. We also leveraged MobX to design a reactive frontend that automatically updates based on changes in the underlying data.GPT-4 Assistance: To facilitate our development process we occasionally sought help from GPT-4 OpenAI's advanced language model. GPT-4 provided valuable insights suggestions and ideas to improve our project throughout the development journey.By combining these technologies we built a comprehensive solution that addresses NFT interoperability gaming and zkEVM optimization. Our project showcases the potential of blockchain-based entertainment and cross-chain interactions paving the way for future innovations in the space.",

We achieve this by tracking the inflow and outflow of tokens and using existing rate limiting heuristics to determine if a transaction is a probable hack. This smart contract acts like a proxy between the defi protocol and the broader chain. Using this proxy we can determine if a token outflow is a likely hack. For example in the euler hack 99% of the TVL disappeared in a few blocks this is something we can surely detect using smart contracts. Additionally we created a web app to monitor the inflow and outflows as well as some quick actions for the admin in the even of a hack.We leverage push notifications to quickly notify the relevant parties.",

Shin is a platform where you can prove your authenticity by completing tracks & quests which are mostly decentralized. By doing this - you would increase your trust score which other dApps would use to prove your humanity. This project uses next.js & chakra on the frontend. We have used solidity for our smart contracts and ethers.js to connect them on the frontend.Project documentation is made on nextra by next.js.The project resides on the Polygon chain.We have used QuickNode for fetching user's on-chain analytics and integrate them into Shin's trust score.Bunzz which we recently discovered helped us deploy our NFT contracts easily which saved us a lot of time.ENS & LENS handle claims and verification were handled by their subgraphs on TheGraph.Lastly Shin's on-chain notifications were made easy using Push Protocol.",

It seems that waging war or threatening to do so is one of the few things that governments are still able to do.While we continue to innovate in all sectors of the economy while innovation in systems of governance have stalled. We leave governance to more learned legal minds and decry the ways government has failed us without proposing or pursuing change on a more systemic level.Squirrly is an attempt to engage people in a process of governance experimentation by understanding better what it is they think government should actually do and allowing them to build one from scratch.Users will engage in a generative storytelling game where decisions are voted on ideological impact of decisions are logged and a squirrel government is formed to protect the squirrel nation from global catastrophe internal strife and attack by birds to hopefully arrive at ideas for better systems of governance and more broadly spark conversation about governance innovation.

This project looks to reduce and/or eliminate the point of creating and uploading multiple instances of private records.  Leveraging ZK technology only specific information and be shared to the verify instead of a full copy of the record.MINA's protocol makes this project possible to create a project that is able to document any relevant information into a off-chain Merkle Tree process while generating a final proof or the root to be stored on-chain.  The project provides a demo of verifying different pieces of information on a simulated medical record.  The project makes use of the assert methods to verify a proof and also allows for updating records off-chain while only storing minimal data of the root on-chain. This project utilizes MINA protocol starting with it's MINA zkApp CLI.  I started learning how to build with MINA and utilized a boilerplate Merkle Tree sample from the documentation.  MINA uses SnarkyJS which allows to program with Typescript.

    description:
      ' creating a web of trust that can be queried to form new networks and test legitimacy.This project aims to create a web of trust on chain where instead of validators or other parties creating universal verification (e.g. verifying to anyone that a given user has a given credential) the trust is personal between people and based on human relationships. A given user is able to say that they trust another in different ways. They can trust the authenticity of another user that is to declare they are a real person (Proof of Personhood). This may be because they have met them in real life at an event such as a hackathon. They can also trust whether the user is truthful and reliable in their judgement. This may be because they are colleagues or friends and know them to be trustworthy. Trusting a user doesn\'t create any sort of "reputation" or "vouch" only posting on chain the fact that I User A trust User B to some extent. Once a user has a direct network they can expand their network of trusted users by looking at the connections of their own connections. For example if User A trusts User B to be real and trustworthy and User B does the same for User C User A can trust that User C is almost definitely real and can make a judgement about whether they fully or partially trust them (or maybe not at all). The project also facilitates making judgements from combining partial trust - if 3 parties User A believes are real but potentially aren\'t trustworthy agree that User B is real and completely trustworthy User A can be sure that User B is almost definitely real and can again make a judgement about how trustworthy they are. The onchain implementation stores trusted parties for each user in a contract allowing them to look up and update their trusts.  A webapp allows users to determine whether other users are within a certain degree of trust of their network. For the scope of this hackathon all networks are public although it could be possible to implement a ZK approach in the future. The frontend uses React/Typescript on Next.js with a bespoke UI component and interaction system. The interface is designed for mobile first. The trust system is stored on chain in a Solidity contract and uses an offchain computation to find paths between users which are validated on chain before being accepted.',

Yet many users today face lock in effects with high switching costs after using a particular wallet and are unable to port over their feature should they intend to change steep barriers to entry since this requires technical knowledge to understand the smart contracts running the wallet and an inflexible tool where they are unable to configure the parameters.The project adopts the ERC4337 standard for account abstraction enabling users to create and customize they own wallet. A platform with plug and play functions allows them to configure their parameters for each particular library supported.These are stateless libraries on the backend which goes into our account abstracted wallet. The codegen library then generates a smart account based on the parameters keyed in and these are passed to the front end in the for of byte code and a signing key. Should the user feel satisfied with these parameters they can then deploy where our platform deploys a smart wallet and this can be supported by any account abstraction wallet such as Argent.The libraries that we have supported include those by Push and AAVE Protocols  to enable updated notifications for users.This creates an easy o understand UI for users to create smart contract wallets based on their desired features and preferences. Our team used nextjs for the front end and for the back end we used codegen to generate a smart account. The Account Abstraction Wallet gets updated with the stateless libraries such as Push and AAVE.With these parameters the byte code is pushed to the front end alongside a signing key. It then deploys a smart wallet on chain and this can be supported on any wallets that has account abstraction such as Argent.Polygon : 0x777D8F64781d8548151bad125B1084eeE12C91D7 on polygon mumbaiGoerli Ethereum: 0xf3C302a9dCe602f2EC571c825240d140B4732f23",

    description:
      "It is basically implementation of this idea suggested by 0xngmi: https://github.com/0xngmi/ideas#vault-for-arbing-withdrawals-on-l2-bridgesOptimistic bridges have long withdrawal times so people that want their money instantly have to use bridges like synapse or hop to cross the gap instantly and because of the way they work this creates some positive slippage if you bridge in.This leads to an arbitrage opportunity where you can bridge 1 ETH and get >1 ETH (eg: 1.01 ETH) on a L2. Afterwards you can withdraw that through the standard bridge getting you >1 ETH back on ethereum.Right now if you did this you could be getting 10-20% APY on ETH which is much higher than on other yield aggregators and the risk profile is much lower (you only need to trust the bridge protocol the moment you are bridging and apart from that only trust point is that L2 will work correctly which is a very safe assumption).The opportunity here is to build a protocol that automates this type of arbitrage so people just deposit money on ethereum and the vault does everything for them. This opportunity is not open to traditional yield aggregators because they all work under the assumption that positions must be liquid.Probably the hardest thing to build here is some algorithm that maximizes APY by leaving some money resting on L1 (you want to bridge when most people are exiting in order to maximize arbs). The project uses foundry and has two contracts. One for the mainnet and one for the L2. The one on mainnet will use third party bridges to bridge from mainnet to L2. The one one L2 will use the official L2 bridge with a waiting period to bridge assets back. The interfaces for Arbitrum and Optimism are different in the case of the official bridge.",

GhoPal creates a frictionless way to create an account abstracted vault that allows anyone to send GHO to any address via their lens domain.Letsa GhoPal!GhoPal aims to solve the widespread frictions of carrying out on chain payments when it comes to gas recipient identification and multiple wallets by using a familiar web2-style sign-up format and gasless transactions enabled by Safe! It makes identifying and paying anyone much easier by allowing a recipient to be discovered by their lens domain making everyone identifiable by their web3 social profile harnessing both Lens Protocol and GHO by Aave!The product allows a user to spin up a gasless vault by harnessing Safe's Auth and Protocol kits the user can then use this vault to send anyone some GHO by using their lens domain as an identifier and the transaction is gasless by harnessing Safe's Relay kit!For a user the flow is as follows:User comes to the website and signs in by Web3 auth they can use any social profile such as email instagram twitter github and many more  they can also create their own lens domain directly in the website.User creates a safe (unless they already have one in which case its automagically picked up) which will be used for gasless transactions on the GhoPal platform.User sends some GHO to their safe which they can use as their account to pay others. (unless they have done so already)User then enters a Lens domain this is used to seamlessly retrieve the recipient of a certain amount of GHO specified by the user.Using Safe and Gelato Relays the GHO is sent to the recipient's wallet and the user doesn't need to pay any gas to send these tokens!You can see your past transactions and all the GHO you have distributed for friends goods and services!We are super excited to demo this project as we believe it will create a real impact to widespread payments throughout crypto. The project uses multiple integrations to achieve its goals the app is entirely based in react and is handled client side creating ultimate privacy and transparency.Josh handled the auth kit and frontendDan handled the frontend and designJib handled the safe relay and paymentsAshlyn handled the lens domain integrationsIts easiest to go step by step through each part of the user flow and how each integration has been used to unlock fast safe and frictionless payments.The account creation system using the Safe auth kit basically uses the web3auth flow to generate an account for the user by taking advantage and using their current social profiles. Josh built this into the frontend and is fully usable. The lens integration for creating a lens account was done by Ashlyn and was done on eth-goerli and interacted directly with the smart contracts.Josh built the safe creation flow and used the protocol kit to do so taking advantage of the safe docs.The Lens domain is used in the recipient field and is used to get the address that is used for payments this was done by Ashlyn and used the ownedBy field of the lens protocol .lens domain.A transaction is constructed using GHO as the token to send. Then the relay kit is used where the user is sponsored to have their funds sent to their desired recipient (syncWithFee could also be used here) but GHO is not currently enabled on the gelato relay fee oracle so cant be used for eth-less transactions which would be the ultimate choice for this product however sponsoring the user is also great UX and makes the process much more seamless and accessible!The transactions are accessed via the gelato api to collect the tx hash and its details/status.",

    description:
      " and rewards the makers of public goods.Shing≈ç app capitalizes on the human tendency to use social media to show the problems in our world.  The flow of the Shing≈ç user then becomes one that turns gamified social interactions into real tangible change in the world.To begin: a user posts a picture and explains what they see and want to change in the world.  Then an impact-maker responds showing the change they have created and listing all the volunteers who helped make it happen.At the time that a project is posted NFT sales can happen.  We can imagine a big NGO funder or interested party hosting a month-long program for example: \"Clean-up our public spaces!\"  Let's say that Carlos' team cleans up their local beaches and removes 400kg from the waters around their town.  Wow!  Everyone who has been to this beautiful beach is excited to see their work and more and more people buy the NFT to show the amazing impact that was had.Behind the scenes the volunteers who cleaned up the beach are awarded based on the NFT holdings.  They also are issued hypercerts at the same time.  We'll go back to this piece later!  For the first program they receive a pay-out based on community excitement for their project and showing the appreciation for the solution.  The person who posted the call-to-action gets to see change being made in the real world!The foundational innovation of Shing≈ç is that this is only the beginning of the funding process.  Let's say it's a year later and an ecological climate NGO wants to review projects who have had the most impact on Central America.  Looking at the metrics of trash which has been pulled out of the ocean by Carlos' team experts from the NGO are able to attest to the lasting impact this has had in protecting an endangered species of sea turtle.  Now the experts attest to the impact - and the community votes using quadratic voting to indicate their excitement.  Amazing!  With all this new attestation showing the true impact of Carlos' project - his team gets paid out by the hypercert automatically to reward them for their work.This solves many problems in the funding space namely: how can the impact makers be distinguished for their true effects over time?  How can we encourage the highest impact projects and celebrate their progress in a renewable and sustainable way? Shing≈ç also includes gamified features and social network functionality that keeps community members coming back and shows badges when they are deemed \"experts\" fit to help judge the true impact of a public goods project.  These in-app systems mean that the most addictive parts of social networks are now used for good to fund public goods in a sustainable way over time.We hope you'll try out Shing≈ç for yourself soon!  We know users will love seeing change in the world and we expect the network to grow exponentially - just like the impact of public goods <3 Shing≈ç is built on top of Lens Protocol for social networks and Superfluid asset streaming protocol. For hosting IPFS has been employed.The core functionality of the social network allows someone to post a problem using Lens protocol for the post and then a project to reply showing that they impacted change.  Behind the scenes an NFT is minted which is sold to the community who is excited about the solution created.  These NFT sales ensure that the volunteers and makers of the public good get paid according to a fixed % over time.The rewards don't just stop at the first NFT sale though. Hypercerts are used to set-up sustainable ongoing rewards for the volunteers and makers of public goods. Right now these reward rates can be set by the team who launches the public goods funding and then these kick-backs execute on Polygon chain as experts and community members signal which projects make the most impact over time. Any project or volunteer who claims money when an NFT is bought also receives their rewards on Polygon network.The importance of Shing≈ç's innovation is that rewards can continuously be redistributed as the true impact increases and experts and the community attest to the impact that has shown up in the world as a consequence of the project.  These \"rounds\" of impact assessment can be opened periodically to add value to the project and signal high impact.  We plan to use Gitcoin's Allo Protocol to allocate funds during these rounds as a mixture of expert attestation and democratic quadratic voting.We deployed on goerli & mumbai testnet to demonstrate the functionality.  Since Hypercerts exist on Optimism and Lens network on Polygon chain we seamlessly created a switch between the two networks to improve the UX without sacrificing functionality.We are excited to have the technology available to fund public goods in a gamified and optimal way that rewards the biggest impact makers over time.",

Companies can issue SBTs to their employees which include details of their work experience projects achievements and other relevant information. When an employee applies for a new job they can provide their SBTs as proof of their skills and experience. This provides a verified and immutable record of an individual\'s work history making the hiring process more efficient and effective for companies.SoulBound Tokens are solving the problem of verifying work experience by providing a secure and immutable way for companies to confirm an applicant\'s claims about their past work history. With SBTs individuals and companies alike can benefit from a more efficient and effective hiring process.Technical Details.We created a new module on Lens to connect it to SBT. Consist on Follow the Module of the candidate‚Äôs profile and other protocol members can interact with this user profile. The candidate must create this new module specify the protocol that wants to join and only members of that protocol can follow him.The interface Contract:It has to make the mapping of the address of current members for the protocol then connect it to the protocol mapping after that there has to vote for a candidate to be accepted. There must specify the number of votes needed to mint the SBT.How does it connect to the protocol profile?There must be a special/Specific publication for the new members to collect the SBT and they must have a minimum number of followers/Vote from the protocol members. We use the ERC-721 standard in OpenZeppelin to create a new contract.contract SoulBoundToken is ERC721 (constructor () ERC721 ("SoulBoundToken" "SBT") {}and then defined the additional functionalities of the token.The code imports the ERC721 contract from the OpenZepelin library and creates a new contract that inherits from it. With the constructor it is going to be linked to a function that sets the name and the symbol of the token.Next it is going to create a mapping of addresses to Token ID\'s and functions:pragma solidity ^0.8.0;import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";contract SoulBoundToken is ERC721 {uint256 public tokenCounter;mapping(address => uint256) public tokenIds;constructor(ProtocolMembers) ERC721("SoulBoundToken" "SBT") {    tokenCounter = 0;}function issueToken(address recipient) public {    uint256 newTokenId = tokenCounter;    _safeMint(recipient newTokenId);    tokenIds[recipient] = newTokenId;    tokenCounter++;}We need to specify if we need additional functionality with the token this will be defined when customizing the specifications from the companies that are going to be creating the SBT.Finally we integrate the smart contract with the Lens protocol.pragma solidity ^0.8.0;import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";contract SoulBoundToken is ERC721 {uint256 public tokenCounter;mapping(address => uint256) public tokenIds;constructor() ERC721("SoulBoundToken" "SBT") {    tokenCounter = 0;}function issueToken(address recipient) public {    uint256 newTokenId = tokenCounter;    _safeMint(recipient newTokenId);    tokenIds[recipient] = newTokenId;    tokenCounter++;}function verifySoulBound(address owner) public view returns (bool) {    uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[owner];    return _exists(tokenId);}}This code adds a verifySoulBound() function that takes an owner address as input and returns a boolean indicating whether that address owns a soul bound token.

    description:
      " protocols can easily reward their loyal users for their continued support and engagement.Nowadays users lack loyalty towards web3 projects because it's so easy to switch from one protocol to another. When we use a dapp we do it to get benefit A in exchange for something. However when a new project appears and offers us benefit A+1 for the same exchange we immediately migrate even if that extra benefit is unsustainable. Then when this new project becomes unsustainable we move on to another creating a mercenary ecosystem.This makes it difficult for protocols to have stable users and forces them to focus only on short-term measures to avoid dying. In web3 coordination it's all about incentives and this behavior occurs because we're not incentivizing users to be loyal to the protocols.LoyalFi is a tool for web3 protocols that provides a simple method for identifying their most loyal users and rewarding them in a straightforward way. It's a tool so each project's strategy for using it will depend on its creativity and innovation to differentiate itself from its competitors.So how is this tool composed? LoyalFi is based on two easy-to-use features:Creation of a loyalty scoring algorithm based on custom parameters:The protocol inputs the smart contracts of its dapp and selects different parameters to quantify such as liquidity provided trading volume frequency of use age etc.Each of these parameters will return values with different units of measure so we normalize them with the simplest statistical formula:Z = (X - Œº) / œÉWhere:X is the value of the parameter obtained for a particular user's wallet.Œº is the mean of the parameter for all users.œÉ is the standard deviation for all users.After that the protocol decides how much weight or importance to assign to each parameter according to how much it wants it to affect the loyalty score. For example if governance is highly valued the protocol should assign a lot of weight to the governance interaction parameter.Once we have the normalized values and their respective weights we do a weighted sum to get the ranking.Snapshot and NFT:We can take a snapshot at the chosen date and time and for the number of users to reward (e.g. the first 300) and automatically create a smart contract that only loyal users can mint.This NFT serves as an on-chain pointer to identify who the loyal users are and facilitate the delivery of rewards. For example some rewards could be:Distribution of monthly revenue returnsAccess to beta featuresAccess to events or collaborations with other projectsThese are just some examples; the idea is to create the tool so that each project's creativity can maximize its potential. This project is a Loyalty app built primarily using Python Flask and JavaScript. The backend is powered by Flask a lightweight web framework for Python which handles routing and server-side logic. The frontend is built using HTML CSS and JavaScript (also known as Vanilla JS) which is responsible for the UI and interaction with the backend.Here is an overview of the technologies used and how they're pieced together:Flask (Python web framework): Handles routing and server-side logic such as checking wallet eligibility for NFT claims and fetching user data from The Graph API.The Graph API: Provides data about liquidity providers and their respective addresses. The data is fetched in the backend using GraphQL queries and Python's requests library. This sponsor technology allowed us to easily access on-chain data and improve the overall performance of the app.Gnosis: gnosis is the blockchain that we use to deploy our smart contractsHTML CSS and JavaScript: Constructs the user interface and handles user interactions. JavaScript is used to connect to MetaMask and manage user wallet connections.MetaMask: A browser extension used for managing Ethereum wallets. It's integrated into the app through JavaScript to enable users to connect their wallets and check eligibility for NFT claims.As for the project's structure the Flask app handles the routes and renders templates for each page. HTML templates are used with Jinja2 templating engine to provide dynamic content based on the user's interactions. CSS is used to style the pages ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.There weren't any particularly hacky elements in this project. The main focus was on providing a clean functional and straightforward experience for the user. The components were designed to be modular and extensible making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones in the future.",

After successful authentication an EOA is automatically created and associated with the user from there which they can proceed to create their smart account.Smart accounts that are created in Social Account may have shared ownership. When smart account is shared among multiple owners it gives opportunity for Social Recovery to happen. Even when one account is compromised another account owner can come in and revoke the ownership status of the compromised owner. Another Social Recovery use case is when an owner loses access to the primary provider they rely on they can still login with another account and ask other owners to grant him new ownership. This is an extra secure flexible feature that is not available in the traditional EOA.Social Account also supports transactions between accounts. Social Account is a frontend only app primarily using react deployed using Vite. For UI elements we have dabbled around with everygreen-UI. For the core smart account manipulation we took advantage of Safe  SDK especially its Auth Kit and Protocol Kit packages.Safe SDK is the reason why we got the app up and working in this short window of time.

      " fund and support projects without intermediaries. This project is a DeFi with a user interface for creating and publishing fundraising projects on an Ethereum blockchain network. It allows users to input project details including a project title description target amount deadline and image and submit them to the blockchain network to be published as a smart contract. They could also get a notification after donating to a project. The program was built using a variety of technologies including React Vite MetaMask Polygon Goerli ThirdWeb Push Protocol and Solidity. React was used as the frontend framework to build the user interface while Vite was used as the build tool to compile the code. MetaMask was used as the wallet provider enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network. Polygon was chosen as the blockchain network to host the application due to its low transaction fees and high scalability. Goerli was used as the test network for development and testing purposes. ThirdWeb was used as a middleware and dev platform Push for notifications while Solidity was used to write the smart contracts that power the application's functionalities. The program also includes error handling for invalid inputs and loading animations to provide a better user experience.",

      ' it is common for multiple protocols to send the same tweet at the same time for marketing purposes. Balus enables this functionality on Lens as well.The Balus project is a tool to promote the growth of crypto-SNS culture.Crypto SNS culture has a unique feature which is cooperative promotion.Many protocols such as zkSync and Base post tweets with the same content at the same time.Not only does this have a high marketing impact but it is also a culture unique to crypto that values cooperation over intense competition.Balus is a tool designed to foster this culture.In other words it provides a tool for many protocols to easily collaborate and post simultaneously.Synchronising content and timing on Twitter can be very time consuming. Posting at the same time puts a lot of strain on the team.Balus is there to remove this burden. No more tedious coordination. Simultaneous posting can be fully automated.There is also no limit to the number of participants. Over 100 protocols can post simultaneously like a festival.Simultaneous posting must be kept private. The posting has to be a surprise.Of course Balus also has the functionality to post privately.Although Balus is still a work in progress development will continue to make it a great service that can be used by more and more protocols.Slides:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pYSBBLFERy9lJSHIyjptJKSZRN-GMwqM3Rea4M04aR8/edit?usp=sharing Balus has a simple configuration consisting only of the "Lens protocol" IPFS Pinning Service "Pinata" and a original smart contract.We uses the "Pinata" Submarine API to temporarily manage files privately. Prior to simultaneous posting post contents are stored in a private storage to prevent anyone other than the relevant parties from knowing the contents. Just before posting the contents are broadcast to the public IPFS network.Our original contract has built-in logic to prevent participants in simultaneous posting from cheating.On "Lens Protocol" the Dispatcher function is used to grant permissions for posting to the custom contract.',

Highly compressed image data (SVG) storing on the blockchain.Because storing images on the blockchain is so expensive many creators struggle to compress the data.With our product creators simply upload the images they have created and we automate the process of compressing them and storing them on the blockchain.b. ERC721-based NFT that enables peer-to-peer and trustless transactions.ERC721 has a few fundamental issues.Royalties are not enforceable.Many NFTs are stolen.It is not decentralized.In order to solve this problem we need to create "ERC721P2P" which performs transactions without trusted third parties (P2P transactions) and makes it possible to enforce royalties. These two mechanisms (SVG compressing and peer-to-peertrustless transactions) are independent of each other and have been developed by us as open source projects.The result of this hackathon was the fusion of these two mechanisms and their release as a website.We have built a web-based UI to make our SVG compression mechanism easily accessible to many creators.To address situations where our SVG compression mechanism may not be able to fully convert an image we have enabled a side-by-side comparison of the original image and the compressed image.Set a link URL for each work so that creators can easily spread their work.(*) The registered Github URL is mainstream.The deliverables of the hackathon is in the following branch.https://github.com/Cryptocoders-wtf/generative/tree/feat/ETHGlobal2023',

This means that once a user creates a limit order they no longer need to actively monitor the market to execute the trade.Composable - AbswapX can be easily integrated into other DeFi protocols enabling composability and allowing developers to create more complex trading strategies.The module is truly composable and trustless any developer can build on top of it to enable cross-chain DeFi automation across any EVM chain of their preference by choosing the protocols they want to interact with. AbswapX is deployed on Gnosis Chain and Polygon Chain. While on the testnet we are deployed on Goerli Mumbai Polygon zkEVM Linea ScrollzK Taiko and Mantle.When a user creates a limit order they specify the token pair they want to trade the price they want to buy or sell at and the amount of tokens they want to trade.The limit order is then added to the AbswapX order book. We leverage Gelato Network to create a proxy task with call data as per the limit order specified by the user's EOA or account abstraction.When the price of the token pair reaches the user's specified price the Gelato Network executes the trade automatically. The user's tokens are then swapped for the desired tokens at the specified price.For swaps on the Gnosis chain we use Honeyswap V2 RouterFor swaps on the Polygon chain we use Uniswap V3 RouterFor swaps across these chains we use Connext Protocol to bridge the liquidity and call data from the source chain and execute it on the destination chainAnyone can create limit orders and DCAs across tokens across Gnosis and Polygon by using the product from the frontend as well.",

In this way both developers and users can benefit from social sign-in account abstraction and additionally the paymaster sponsor. We built the widget component and a sample mint site using NextJS TypeScript alongside a suite of smart contracts to support the ERC-4337 paymaster functionality curated by the Ethereum Foundation. We made custom changes to the paymaster smart contract to support our goal of being able to sponsor both the transaction value and the transaction fee for the user in exchange for a Stripe/ERC-20 token equivalent.We utilize auth0 for seamless social login and transaction signatures. Our smart contracts are deployed on Polygon and Goerli with future plans of supporting ApeCoin and Aave.

      " a decentralized futures trading exchange meets users expectations to invest in a way it provides back both stability and constant high yield returns. It is designed to be extremely simple and straightforward - any crypto beginners are also able to use easily.In the recent years the popularity of futures trading exploded as it returned highest yields especially in the world of DeFi where high fluctuations exists. Futures trading is proven to provide stability by its hedging mechanism and at the same time maintaining high profit when chosen the right volatility. However the appearance of futures trading resulted DeFi users to lean more towards profitability in trading that exposes their positions to the heightened price volatility. High gas costs resulted for syncing off-chain data inevitable as well resulting in a less decentralized dapp counterfeiting blockchain‚Äôs main functions.We have figured this problem by implementing a fully decentralized futures exchange through integration of on-chain AMM formulas. This easily decides the cost of the position from given amount to buy. This is essential as it solves high gas costs when trying to form a cost in other ways for instance order book mechanism. Bringing in an existing AMM formula also helps in deriving a simpler structural mechanism leading into high scalability and compatibility interchain and layers.We introduce you Defutures Decentralized Futures.Defutures is a fully decentralized futures trading exchange. It is designed simple easy and stable like no others. It does not support open book instead integrates with an existing DeFi protocol‚Äôs AMM using it to provide the strike amount for futures positions. An existing spot pair and futures pair will converge to one another under given circumstances and when convergence occurs logic behind futures exchange is fulfilled. Our main audiences are not traders instead crypto / trading beginners. Thus we have implemented a contract call that does both the staking and hedging using futures trading to provide stability in the investment model.Defutures is fully flexible as it welcomes multiple chains and layers and to DeFi protocols with an existing AMM. It is structured to focus solely on providing low-risk investment products to the user and at the same time guaranteeing constant profits. Therefore being designed in a simple straightforward manner scalability throughout the entire blockchain system is relatively easily drawn. Overall development directionTo maximize the user's investment experience we designed the platform to enable DEX investments and hedging positions with a single ERC20 asset in a single transaction.As the hedging products target users who are new to crypto we designed a user-friendly interface that clearly shows how the user's actions affect their investment returns and risks.To calculate values such as strike amount margin ratio and tolerance in real-time based on the user's input we chose to perform complex calculations directly on the front-end instead of fetching pre-computed values from the blockchain.We utilized a Typescript-focused technology stack to enable all builders to share their products and provide constructive feedback to each other.FrontEndWe worked on a project using React and TypeScript for the frontend.To quickly connect to the blockchain and ensure efficiency and security of the work We utilized the Metamask SDK for connection.We adopted the immutable function structure of Uniswap and calculated values such as \"Strike\" and \"AmountIn\" on the frontend.In this case We utilized Multicall extensively to obtain the balances of various ERC20 assets across multiple chains.To make our service user-friendly for those who are new to crypto We designed it with a user-friendly interface.For example even if there is only one token users can still set a pair and have the opportunity to engage in future trading.We simplified complex functions such as hedging amount and margin ratio for easy understanding.We believe this will greatly contribute to the expansion of Web3 solutions.BackendWe utilized a database to track user position creation changes and removal. As we aimed to implement a fully decentralized service we did not use the backend for core trading functionalities. However we used a database for the convenience of users.Smart ContractWe developed a smart contract using Hardhat and Solidity language. As the futures market differs from the spot market and can cause arbitrage when the price rises immediately after buying it was challenging to implement an AMM for the futures market. Therefore we created our own futures market AMM that is simple yet accurately sets the futures price by modifying Uniswap's CPMM.In addition we completed the contract development using UniswapV2Router to create the product and SwapRouter and NonfungiblePositionManager in UniswapV3Router. With the use of the Router we were able to implement the addLiquidity and Hedge functions for the users.Furthermore we created our own UniswapV2DefutureRouter and UniswapV3DefutureRouter by modifying the Router and implemented addPosition clearPosition and Hedge functions with them.To prove that it can be executed on various networks we deployed it on Mumbai Scroll Linea Taiko Celo and Mantle networks.",

It is meant to be soulbound data (did:walletaddress) containing proofs of the work the user has done. The proofs are not restricted to a token or a community but an aggregate data proof of the user.The user requests a claim saying they have done a task. Mercle (for now but later will be decentralized to the community level) will verify and attest the request claim if the claim is valid by signing the request with a Mercle wallet. This claim will be made verifiable onchain in the MembershipNFT contract.The MembershipNFT contract has CLAIM_ISSUER_ROLE role with the Mercle address as whitelisted. The plan is any person with the role should be able to issue claims.2.Rewards ProfileThis is the NFT contract that contains all rewards the user has claimed for the tasks they have performed. The claims and rewards are attested by Mercle wallet (has CLAIM_ISSUER_ROLE on contract).The NFT contract has two important variables isOpenMint and isTradable. isOpenMint allows anybody to mint tokens from the contract which can be toggled on/off. isTradable allows the tokens to be transferred from one address to another to make the token soulbound or tradable. It can be toggled on/off as well.There is another function mintNFTCampaign to allow users to mint from contract based on whitelisting. A minter will have to submit merkle proof and other parameters for minting. This is used when isOpenMint is not enabled and minting is allowed for selected few (eg community members).",

      'ERC721F tokens are actually composed of two contracts: An ERC721 and an ERC20 contract. State is shared and synced between them so balances can be manipulated using either! Transferring ERC20 tokens will result in ERC721 tokens in being moved around and vice versa!To hold a non-zero balance of the ERC721 token you must have some (fixed) multiple of the ERC20 token. If your ERC20 balance dips below a multiple one of your NFTs will be set aside to be awarded to the next user that reaches a new ERC20 balance multiple. On the flip side transferring individual ERC721 tokens results in a multiple of ERC20 tokens being transferred as well.The system is designed to be compatible with AMM architectures at all stages of the collection lifecycle. During setup ERC20 tokens can be minted to a pool without backing ERC721 tokens so they can be lazy-minted when ERC20 tokens are transferred out of the AMM pool to buyers. This mechanism allows NFT collections to use the "Initial Dex Offering" strategy of distributing their mints. There are many benefits to this approach:Instant liquidity even before the first mint.Automatic price scaling with demand.Everyone whale or minnow can get in on the action!Collection owner receives perpetual royalties in the form of AMM fees while they maintain their position. The core project is all solidity using foundry as the dev testing and deployment framework. It frankensteins the ERC721 and ERC20 standards together.

This approach is great for devs that want a the most trust-minimized option but its quite expensive and inefficient to prove the same statement across many rollups multiple times.That's why we decided to use Hyperlane in order to bridge data from a source chain to any chain that supports their permissionless deployment. We first deploy a zkOracle app in Mina which takes care of verifying data from our oracle. The retrieved state from the oracle as well as the state of the Mina ledger are retrieved we then compute an auxiliary proof for Mina's ledger proof and pass that and the account state to a verifier on [INSERT EVM CHAIN OF CHOICE].Once we have the Mina verification setup deployed we deploy the Hyperlane contracts our contracts that connect the verifier to the Hyperlane mailbox as well as the rest of the setup required for Hyperlane.",

On our app you can collect dynamically generated creatures and battle them against others to prove you're the best trainer of them all.Every EthMonster has a unique moveset giving it unique strengths weaknesses and play style. There are 150 different monsters each with original artwork that was created during this hackathon. All of this is stored fully on chain allowing anyone to create their own game modes or media that use these characters.The goal of our project was to be an inspiration for what the next generation Pokemon is going to look like. It's going to be built by a distributed community building together on the world computer. There were 3 main components of the project:Art - all the art for the EthMonsters was made during the course of the hackathon. We used Midjourney to generate stunning images and converted them into compressed SVGs so they could be stored on chain as the NFTs tokenURI. We deployed the creatures to multiple chains so multiple communities would be able to play (Polygon mumbai Polygon zkevm Scroll Taiko Gnosis Mantle)Gameplay - the gameplay was inspired by the original pokemon games but we added  a mana system to prevent users from spamming moves and to add more strategy. The game runs on our fastapi server and we serve game state to the client using websockets. Our web app is designed from scratch with next.js. Users can connect their Metamask and sign a to create a \"sign in with ethereum\" functionality so users can make authenticated requests to the game server. We also display a users collection of NFTs by using ethers to fetch the data from the deployed contract. We used QuickNode for as our rpc provider service to make contract calls.Contracts - We used mostly the Atlas IDE to develop the smart contracts with the addition of Foundry for gas estimation functionality and writing an advanced deploy script. We wrote 2 main contracts: a URI encoder contract and the main NFT. The encoder stored all encoded SVGs and move list for each EthMonster. We had a 721 contract that used this contract to get tokenURIs. Since each SVG was so large we had to write a custom deploy script that would preprocess the images convert them to minified SVGs and send 1 transaction at a time.",

    description:
      " we prove that all game execution factors (such as allocating territory and rolling dice) is fair and trustless.The project aims to create a decentralized implementation of the popular board game \"Risk\" using the Mina protocol. The game will allow players to compete against each other in a virtual world and conquer territories using armies just like the traditional game.The game will be implemented as a smart contract on the Mina blockchain which will handle all the game logic player actions and state transitions. The smart contract will be written in Typescript and all the logic that runs will be generated into a proof that is verified on the Mina blockchain.The game has a user-friendly front-end interface that allows players to interact with the smart contract and participate in the game. We allow a maximum of four players. Territories are currently laid out as a grid of buttons but will soon look like a map as in the Risk game. The front-end interface is built with Next-js.Players will be able to join the game by signing in with their Mina wallet. They will be assigned random territories across the map with each territory having 7 troops. They will then be able to deploy their troops to different territories on the game board and attack other players' armies. The game will be simultaneous meaning players can attack as they choose as long as they have the troops to do so.The game will incorporate the Poseidon hash function to determine the outcomes of battles making it more unpredictable and exciting. We determine if the hash of the two player id's & the attacking player's nonce is even or odd then use that to determine which side wins the battle and defeats the opposite troops. We wanted to use a recursive proof to verify the Poseidon hash in batches but had a time constraint and had to move onto other things.Overall the project aims to provide a fun engaging and decentralized gaming experience to players around the world while leveraging the unique features of the Mina protocol to ensure fairness transparency and security. This project is fully built on Mina protocol. We implemented the entire project in Typescript. Our smart contract implements functions for starting a game playing a move and verifying a player. Our helper class defines a struct for a Territory and implements functions for attacking serializing our state Field element (will discuss later) claiming & transferring territory ownership checking for winners and rolling the hash dice.We used the Poseidon hash function to add some randomness to the dice roll. As described earlier we used the attacking and defending user's id's + the attacking user's account nonce to generate a unique hash. If that hash was even we'd give the attacker the win. If odd the defender won.One hacky thing in particular that we did was represent the entire game state with one 256 bit Field element. The first 80 bits were used to represent the 16 territories using 5 bits each. The first 2 bits defined the player that owned it the last 3 bits defined the amount of troops that were left. We then used 16 more bits to count the number of territories each player owned. they all started with 4 but if someone reached 1111 they won the game.",

    description:
      "This project implements a missing link of trust in the web3 ecosystem: a decentralized mechanism for users to verify that they are interacting with the correct smart contracts and dApp for the protocol they intend. It is implemented in two components: a dApp/contract registry for protocols and a MetaMask snap that checks potential transactions against the registry.The registry is a smart contract that allows protocols to announce their web2 dApp domains and confirm ownership while also indicating which smart contract addresses belong to the dApp. This public indication on the blockchain where users can interact with their protocol is intended to be part of a larger entity verification mechanism where protocols can announce their legitimate points of contact for both web2 and web3 (dApp domains smart contract addresses for each chain Twitter discord etc) and confirm ownership of each like a decentralized keybase.io for web3 entities.The other main component of this project is a Metamask snap that allows users to query the registry for each transaction verifying that the dApp domain is registered and that the smart contract addresses match the domain. A fully-realized implementation of this scheme would prevent users from interacting with lookalike scam websites (because the registry would confirm ownership of multiple identity references) and could even stop front-end hacks (because the attacker would need to co-opt the domain demonstrate ownership and publicly update the trusted contract addresses in the registry). In the future this mechanism could be implemented as part of every wallet to provide an indication of trust similar to the familiar green checkbox in the URL bar for browsers.The ultimate vision of this project is a verification mechanism that can work on any blockchain and gives users the confidence that they're interacting with the actual protocol much the same way that the certificate authorities provide users confidence for web2 but in a decentralized manner. To get setup a protocol hosts a signature accessible at https://theirdomain.com/proof.txt and uses our Dapp written in Next.js‚Äîwhich first checks if the proof is present from off-chain‚Äîto obtain a management role (which is transferred to the recovered address). This role is then used to submit which contracts are \"trusted\" by the protocol.When MetaMask opens to confirm a transaction our MetaMask cross-references the contract the transaction interacts with the set of trusted contract addresses (which are keyed by the domain name).Under the hood the smart contract includes a number of safety features and ensures there is no centralization risk.The worst case scenario if our proof-checking bot (which allows protocols to get setup with us) were to go offline is that no more protocols can get setup. In the future we intend to use oracles to eliminate this possibility but it poses no security or centralization risk.We (the owner) cannot revoke or control trusted contract lists after a timelock period.However upon registration of a protocol we are given a 72-hour ‚Äúdispute‚Äù period to unregister a protocol. This stops a potential attack where an unregistered protocol‚Äôs website is compromised to host an attacker‚Äôs proof.This MetaMask snap applies to all transactions and sources; however if a protocol is not registered with us we show no warning (i.e. it can only add safety/benefit).Our project allows any project to have a form of pausing (at least warning users) without having to implement a pausing backdoor in the contract. For example if a protocol were hacked the owners could empty the trusted contracts list so that all MetaMask users are prompted with a warning before interacting with the contract.The contracts are deployed on multiple blockchains including Polygon's Mumbai testnet allowing protocols to register their valid dApp/smart contract address mappings for each chain.The MetaMask snap is pure JavaScript that checks the registry for each transaction and presents information or warnings to the user.",

    description:
      "Our project explores the possibilities of moving certain legal documentation on-chain. We looked into SAFT NDA and SAFE agreements. Currently these off-chain forms of documentation are used to dictate on-chain activity which is obviously not enforceable on-chain. We believe that bridging this gap between web2 and web3 specifically in the scope of SAFT agreements where we have personally seen multi-million dollar checks pulled illegally by VC's serves a valuable purpose. Enabling a seamless UX from on-ramping of crypto directly on our site to gasless meta transactions and an easy to use UX is something we hoped to achieve. We develop a dynamic ERC-1155 NFT token standard for representing \"signed\" states of users for a common legal document. For SAFT agreements in particular there is an important money movement piece involved so we integrate with SuperFluid to enable streaming of assets after a certain period. Coupled with our thorough smart contract development we put together a slick full stack NextJS application building off the metamask SDK SAFE's on-ramping and deployed to several L2's and test networks. For the UI we used NextJS to take advantage of both client and server side rendering and dynamic file system routing. We built our web3 authentication using metamask's SDK and incorporated SAFE's on-ramp kit for allowing users to on-ramp USDC if they don't already have. Even further we incorporate Uniswap v3 protocols to allow users to natively supply a token other than USDC and we'll execute a swap transaction to USDC (a more easily understood asset generally should not be volatile compared to other assets). Our smart contracts are built off ERC 1155 standards where we develop dynamic NFT's referencing the multi-owner contracts and their corresponding signing statuses for a given SAFT/NDA contract. This allows us to pair with the frontend to display to users which states their SAFT/NDA contracts are in and which actions they are able to take. We built on SuperFluid's vesting scheduler to enable the money-movement component of our contract where we essentially hold USDC in escrow until an agreed upon date (token unlock) then stream the tokenized equity directly to a user at a given flow rate. We built in Biconomy's meta transactions to sponsor gas for users which can sometimes be a large deterrent for users. The tokenID is enforceable on-chain by using a hashed version of important metadata surrounding a contract (such as user's name company name document title etc...) which is stored off-chain for safety.",

We have primarily used the Metamask SDK the Lens protocol and the Reclaim SDK.The metamask SDK makes it easier for us to connect to the blockchain through the browser extension. There is no need to share the private key. The SDK exposes a provider that can request transactions to be signed on the wallet.Reclaim SDK is based on the Reclaim protocol that allows a person to export any data from any website on the internet and generate a zk-proof out of it. It is completely trustless and privacy preserving. Such a protocol puts the user in complete control of their data. They are reclaiming their data from websites' databases. This data is rightfully theirs and should have sovereignty over how and where this data is used.This effectively means every single website is now converted into an API. Being dependent on TLS 1.3 Reclaim protocol would always work unless the website decides to change their underlying network structure model.Lastly once Metamask is connected the Lens Client SDK is used to fetch the Lens ID owned by the address. Once we have that we allow the user to uniquely generate a claim that they have contributed to a particular github repository. The Reclaim Wallet opens up where the user can claim and submit the proof on-chain.",

      "The project enables users with low crypto literacy to invest in digital asset indexes and build a diversified portfolio. More than 90 percent of those interested in crypto never start investing in crypto because they find it time consuming difficult to understand and end up adopting a trial and error approach to crypto investing.There‚Äôs a clear preference for passive investment in equities. For some context the passive investment market in equities is 3x the active investment market. Crypto exchanges solve for active investment use cases but the passive investment market is unserved. We believe digital asset indexes can be a simple and easy entry point to bring the next wave of crypto investors.It extends the concept of smart contracts as a wallet to create dedicated contract accounts linked to the user‚Äôs public key/external owned accounts for buying and selling these indexes. These digital asset indexes enable users to own actual ownership of the underlying erc20 tokens in the index versus issuing an index token or a derivative/synthetic token.Users can pick edit customize allocations of any digital asset index. We believe this is the biggest differentiating factor as it truly fulfills the core crypto principles of open finance decentralization and censorship resistance.It uses Uniswap v3 to route the swap transactions through multicall. We use batch transactions to save gas for our users. Users can swap these indexes back for erc20 or withdraw these underlying tokens back to their external owned accounts with the withdraw function. This project uses Uniswap v2/v3 as required depending on the underlying network for completing the swaps between erc20 and indexes. Our main contract swaptoken.sol uses Uniswap v2/v3 and extends the functionality of clone factory pattern to create contract accounts for users which helps manage their digital asset indexes.We explored the use of 1inch KyberSwap and other DEX aggregators but the best price for our users was available at Uniswap v3. Hence we decided to write the smart contracts for integrating v3 directly into our platform.We are deployed on Taiko Scroll and Polygon POS. We believe that users on Taiko and Scroll will benefit largely from our deployment as it will give users the ability to build a diversified crypto portfolio in minutes.As the user base on Taiko grows we will be able to serve a large count directly with a mode wide variety of tokens.We uploaded our contracts to the Bunzz smart contract hub and also used modules which were open source and previously available on the hub.

Uses Plonk-ish arithmetization to make universal parameters used for different circuits. Requires no trusted setup.Asset proof is to declare you have e.g. \"X\" amount of asset in your wallet without revealing which address that is. This experiment seeks to combine recent works from a few different projects to see if a proof could be created in zero-knowledge. Referenced projects include Halo2 Halo2wrong zkevm-circuits.There currently are two different versions of Halo2 in the scene: the one that is originally written by Zcash foundation and the other which was forked by Ethereum foundation. One of the significant differences between the two is the curves and commitment schemes they support.EF's project promotes BN254 curve and KZG commitment scheme to be used as well as the Pasta curves and Inner Product Argument supported by the original version. KZG commitment scheme involves toxic waste and BN254 curve is said to have a rather questionable security guarantee. However we found that an earlier work by EF in dealing with a foreign (wrong) field arithmetic interesting and wanted to test how fast and realistic this can be applied to real-world settings.We learned that wrong field arithmetization Pasta curves Poseidon hash function and IOP can all come together to create an asset proof of a tree depth 32. Creating a proof takes over 60 seconds in the consumer-grade machine (outside of web browser) and a size of the proving key exceeds 6GB.Although it is remarkable that the proof could be made in such a condition where the number of constraints was over 600000 we found that it is still a few steps away from being used as in a consumer's device. The major culprit seems to be the use of foreign fields. It seems that we either have to use only a single field in a circuit or come up with a more performant way of dealing with multiple fields.",

The use of zero-knowledge proofs ensures that user data and transaction details remain confidential while account abstraction allows users to interact with the network without ever worry about losing their account. This project utilized the accountjs.xyz open-source library to implement the wallet interaction and recovery functionality. This library offers a set of APIs and tools for developers to integrate with different blockchain networks making it easy to create and manage blockchain-based applications.To design the frontend of the application the project utilized two popular frontend design frameworks: Material-UI (also known as MUI) and Tailwind CSS. Material-UI provides a comprehensive set of React components that follow Google's Material Design guidelines while Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first CSS framework that allows for fast and flexible styling.For the recovery relayer the project made use of Next.js a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. Next.js provides a range of features and benefits including automatic code splitting optimized performance and server-side rendering making it an ideal choice for building the recovery relayer.For the bundler and account abstraction we get extensively huge helps from eth-infinitism project",

And while it is certain that better imitations can be created it is intolerable to have a prompt that one has spent a long time creating be copied for free.We have created this "Prompt NFT Tree" in the hope that by using blockchain technology we can solve the above problems and develop prompt engineering.The prompt NFT tree is a service that grows prompts together and NFTs are created from AI prompts. Each time a prompt is reused the developer is rewarded. The prompt\'s purchase history can be traced through blockchain technology to watch the prompt grow.In addition the NFT is created with LIT encryption technology which allows the prompt to be held more securely so the prompt is not stored on-chain. This project uses Metamask. The network uses TAIKO which is fast and inexpensive to create contracts. The front end uses svelte and the back end uses firebase. When storing the prompts in NFT we encrypt them using the LIT protocol. This has allowed us to keep the prompts more securely. In addition we use generativeAI to generate the images.The use of TAIKO lowers the cost of gas for the NFT and lowers the barrier to participation for the general public. We were also able to easily port the Solidity code during development.With LitProtocol we can easily implement encryption with access control.Prompts encrypted with LIT Protocol are written to TAIKO\'s NFT.',

      " in a single watch-mode console output.A simple CLI tool for managing TypeScript and Solidity in tandem in watch-mode.As the Solidity contract code is updated and saved to disk it is automatically re-compiled and new Contract type definitions are saved which then trigger the TypeScript compiler.Any Solidity errors or warnings are also included in the TypeScript compiler console making it easy to make sure the entire project is in shape. The project is quite simple and includes a few low-level APIs with a high-level watch-mode CLI on top of it.The low-level API for Solidity compilation simplifies interacting with contract source (there is still plenty of work to do here though) and another API provides TypeScript interface generation for the derived ABI and bytecode using the ethers v6 Typed Contract API.",

      " displaying contract interactions by followed users to flag potential spam 2) GPT-4 reviewing transaction methods highlighting risks 3) Worldcoin KYC authentication. Prevent accidental spam contract approvals!This project aims to enhance the Ethereum blockchain wallet called MetaMask Snap by developing extensions to improve security user experience and provide additional services. MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to easily manage cryptocurrencies and digital assets as well as perform transactions. The project's primary goals are as follows:Lens Protocol Integration for Security Enhancement:By integrating Lens Protocol the system will display on MetaMask whether people you follow using the protocol have previously interacted with the smart contract.If no one you follow has ever executed the contract this could indicate potential spam helping users make informed decisions.GPT-4 Integration for Security Enhancement:Before executing a transaction the method's purpose and risks will be reviewed using GPT-4 with explanations displayed within MetaMask.This feature aims to reduce the likelihood of users inadvertently approving malicious contracts or transactions.Worldcoin Authentication for KYC (Know Your Customer) information:Users will be unable to access services without proper identification and verification.This ensures that only verified individuals can participate enhancing overall security.Superfluid Subscription Services:Superfluid enables subscription services with payments at a per-second granularity.This feature allows users to pay for subscription services in real-time enhancing the overall experience.The main issue the project addresses is the lack of transparency and understanding of the transactions being executed on smart contracts. Users may not know or check the details of the transaction leading to an increased risk of inadvertently approving spam contracts. The integration of Lens Protocol and GPT-4 aims to resolve this issue by improving security measures and providing essential information to users before executing a transaction. To build this project we utilized a combination of technologies and frameworks piecing them together to achieve the desired functionality and user experience. The primary components include MetaMask Snaps Lens Protocol GPT-4 Worldcoin and Superfluid. Here's an overview of how each technology was integrated and their respective roles in the project:MetaMask Snaps:We used MetaMask Snaps to extend the functionality of MetaMask allowing us to show additional information and security features before a transaction is executed. MetaMask SDK facilitated the creation of custom MetaMask plugins to achieve this.Lens Protocol:Lens Protocol is integrated into the project to provide an added layer of security. We used Lens Protocol API to fetch the profile and contract execution history of users being followed. This information is displayed in MetaMask helping users identify potentially spammy or untrustworthy contracts.GPT-4:We used GPT-4 API to analyze and review the methods being executed in the transaction. GPT-4 provided a summary of the contract information as well as a description of potential risks which are displayed in MetaMask for user consideration.Worldcoin:Worldcoin's KYC (Know Your Customer) feature was integrated into the project to ensure that only verified users can access the service. Users who have not completed the KYC process are prompted to authenticate their identity during transaction confirmation.Superfluid:We integrated Superfluid to enable subscription services with per-second billing. This innovative feature allows for more flexible and precise subscription plans for users.To tie all these technologies together we employed several tools and frameworks including Truffle Infura and Linea:Truffle: Truffle framework was used for smart contract development testing and deployment.Infura: Infura was used as an Ethereum node provider allowing us to connect our application to the Ethereum network.Linea: Linea a sponsor technology was employed for secure performant and seamless management of the project's smart contracts.Although we did not employ any particularly hacky solutions our project demonstrates an innovative use of these technologies and frameworks to provide an enhanced user experience and improve security during transactions. By combining the capabilities of MetaMask Snaps Lens Protocol GPT-4 Worldcoin and Superfluid we aimed to tackle the issues of spam contracts and unintentional transaction approvals.",

In the post (https://ethresear.ch/t/reducing-challenge-times-in-rollups/14997) Ed proposes a statistical test to determine censorship using on-chain information in block headers alone. The test is based on ethereum consensus mechanisms and as Ed suggests can speed up optimistic systems.We implement Ed's spec and create an optimistic hash bridge called O-Hashi integrating our censorship oracle and Gnosis' Hashi bridge to resolve disputes. Here's how O-Hashi worksAnyone can make a claim about a hash by leaving a deposit and automatically starting a censorship test in the censorship oracle.a) Anyone can challenge the claim by leaving a deposit. We call the Gnosis Hashi bridge to resolve the challenge bridging the true hash securely. If Hashi never responds we refund both the claimant and the challenger and no hash is validated.ORb) After the challenge period elapses the claim can be optimistically accepted if the censorship test passes. If the censorship test fails Hashi is called to validate the hash. This project is built on:PythonJupyter NotebooksThe GraphReactHardhat SolidityUniquely for a web3 project atleast this project involves high precision off-chain calculations requiring hundreds of digits of numerical precision implemented in python to calculate the censorship oracle test parameters. You will need Jupyter notebooks to open the .ipynb files.The censorship oracle solidity contracts are deployed with test parameters pre-calculated as constants.The graph is used to implement block handlers to calculate statistics about missing blocks over slot ranges.React is used for a clean dashboard front-end which display missing block information for both Gnosis and Ethereum.The O-Hashi Bridge is implemented as contracts alone while the front-end only displays information about the censorship oracle.",

If you fund the PKP in advance you can execute the social recovery function gaslessly.We use Lens publication and users as social recovery guardians. On the Lit Action the program gets the list of users who have reacted to the publication of Lens Protocol.We attempted to utilize MetaMask Snaps to improve UX in Bailout. However we had a trouble with connecting to Snap so we implemented all logics outside of Snap environment.The application is deployed on Polygon Mumbai.",

The project leverages a decentralized donation model and blockchain technology to increase the transparency and reliability of donations and increase social value. The project is also easy to participate in and highly scalable.Decentralized donation modelThe project operates on an entirely decentralized model as it uses Ethereum smart contracts to process donations. This means that donations are not paid directly to anyone but are processed automatically according to programmed rules. This increases the transparency and reliability of the donation model and reduces the risk of fraud or unfair processing.Utilizing blockchain technologyThe project utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the reliability and integrity of the data. All donations and tree growth are recorded on the blockchain making it impossible to falsify or manipulate the data. This provides a high level of trust for donors and allows for a more transparent and fair donation process.Increasing social valueThe project raises social value which is primarily related to environmental protection. Linking tree growth to environmental protection helps to foster a higher sense of social consciousness and responsibility. The project also combines technological innovation and social value creation in the blockchain ecosystem resulting in a more positive social impact.Easy participation and scalabilityThe project is easy to join on the webpage and all donors can see the growth of the trees corresponding to their donations in real time. The project is also scalable as donations accumulate. As new donors join they can be reflected and the tree's growth can be continuously shown. We just utilized scaffolds to create a very basic working scene. Our project will be built on the Ethereum blockchain. To do this we will write a smart contract to implement logic that will update the height of the tree to match the amount of Ethereum tokens a donor sends. We will also develop a webpage that shows the height of the tree in real time using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js. The blockchain and the frontend will be connected via an API so that every time the height of the tree is updated it will be automatically reflected on the webpage. We will utilize a node service like Infura or Alchemy for this purpose. Finally we will utilize chat platforms like Discord and Telegram for community management.",

It was a loyal companion to customers tucked away in wallets and purses eagerly awaiting its moment to shine. This was the era of stamp cards where each visit to your favorite eatery brought you one step closer to a delectable reward.Fast forward to today a new age of technology and innovation has dawned. MAID brings the nostalgic charm of loyalty stamp cards into the realm of Web3. We\'ve transformed the trusty paper card into a digital wonder offering a seamless and friendly solution for protocol users and developers.Protocols have the ability to define their own requirements for obtaining a stamp. We provide an interface that protocol developers are expected to implement where the verification logic takes place. Once all the requirements are met (the user collects all the stamps on the card) the user is rewarded.The rewards come in the form of ERC3525 tokens (Semi-Fungible Tokens). Protocol developers are also expected to implement the logic determining how these rewards can be used. Some examples include token allocation or airdrops in-protocol discounts and exclusive member benefits. MAID - Multi Access Incentive DistributionWe provide an interface that protocol developers are expected to implement where the verification logic takes place.A Factory contract is responsible for managing all the coupons. After developers implement their requirements logic they should add it to the Factory. Users interact with the Factory when they want to claim their rewards. The Factory forwards the verification logic to the appropriate coupon logic and if successful rewards users with the ERC3525 token.We provide examples for this interface implementation for "Proof of OG" (demonstrating that the user was among the first users or token holders of a specific protocol) "Proof of Badge" (showing that the user holds at least a certain number of Sismo badges) and "Proof of Safe" (proving that the user owns a certain number of Safes).For the verification of the rewards we use Herodotus that allows to prove information cross-chain (for example purposes we check the eligibility on goerli and verify it on starknet) as well as proving historical data.Proof of OG of APE Coin and claim coupon on StarknetProof of OG of GHO Coin and claim coupon on StarknetProof of OG of BOB Coin and claim coupon on StarknetProof of Badge of SISMO Badges and claim coupon on Starknet (TBD)Proof of Safe for owning a certain number of Safes and claim coupon on StarkNet[ TECH STACK ]QuickNode for JSON-RPC callsAave GHO ZkBOB ApeCoin Safe and Sismo for demonstrating potential use cases.NextJS ArgentX Stark-React Stark.js Wagmi for frontendERC3525 for user rewardHerodotus for multi-chain and historical validation of eligibilityCairo for validation contractsUI designs and architecture in Figma',

However the advertising industry is often closed off and lacks transparency with large ad agencies controlling the majority of billboards. Our goal is to revolutionize the city's advertising landscape beginning with digital signages in Tokyo.üí°Our Solution üí°We have created a tokenized fully on-chain digital signage solution. Each digital signage device in the city is assigned a unique token. To advertise on a digital signage simply follow these steps: 1. Purchase the associated token 2. Upload an advertisement NFT and you're all set! Advertisement Control:Ensuring that only those who have purchased the signage token can control the advertisement content on the signages is crucial. To achieve this we have developed a web3 application that works on digital signage IoT devices. The signages then retrieve advertisement content from the blockchain.Content Moderation:Advertisements serve as public goods making content moderation essential. We have addressed this issue by implementing a fully on-chain identity and social credibility verification system powered by Worldcoin and Lens Protocol. This ensures that only appropriate content is displayed on the digital signages.Deployment simplification:To make our digital signage application work efficiently we required two sets of smart contracts: one for the signages and another for the advertisements. In order to manage these contracts without cluttering the codebase we utilized Bunzz. Thanks to Bunzz our dApps can be deployed in a one-stop manner streamlining the entire process.üôèSpecial thanksüôèWorldcoin: Identity verificationLens Protocol: Social credibility qualificationBunzz: One-stop dApps deployment",

Because we were blockchain society! After this I attended a conference in a zk session at BoomLabs and got to know a zk protocol called semaphore. I was convinced that I could create the dApp I imagined through Semephore and decided to use the boilerplate and make additional developments in Hackathon that needed to be supplemented and continue to upgrade after event. There are three things that I tried to supplement. The first is to add permission for only people with NFTs issued by the group to join the group to generate feedback and view the contents. The second is a login feature that saves the value generated when the authorized address joins the group and allows users to view the contents generated in the group as soon as the values match from the contract mapping storage. The third is to modify the transaction occurrence so that the user could occur every transactions by themselves. The last is that we wanted to running on real world for increasing scalability so that others can use our dApp. As I mentioned on the description we used Semaphore zk-procotol. This is Ethereum foundation's technology. Thanks to using this protocol we could make a dApp project what we imagine at the first place. It has really good documentations and good demo. so we used a demo before start. After that we realized that we have to deploy not only Feedback contract but also Semephore contract. Because there were many groups by using Semephore contract that already existed on Polygon Mumbai Test Network. So if we want to handling a group we have to get our own Semephore contract. And we deployed Semephore contract first after that  custormize a Feedback contract what we want to change and make a NFT contract that will be using on Feedback contract. We used Ether.js library when modify the transaction occurrence so that the user could occur every transactions by themselves.and used hardhat when we deploy Semaphore Feedback NFT contracts.",

Traditionally private key recovery methods have been limited by social recovery and device dependence. However ZKVoiceKey allows users to register their own voice (biometric information) on the blockchain in advance making it possible to recover the private key with just their voice in case it is lost.Among the many types of biometric information voice was selected for this project because it can be used to link a person's voice to a message (in this case the transfer of an address).At the time of registrationThe user registers his/her voice (biometric information) in advance via a browser. Fuzzy Commitment is not biometric information itself but rather a commitment which increases security. Fuzzy Commitment is a secure way to manage biometric information as a commitment not as a biometric itself.Restoration.The user extracts features through a machine-learning model of speaker authentication as at the time of enrollment. Next the user compares his/her biometric information with that stored on the blockchain. Fuzzy Commitment is able to recover the biometric bit sequence at the time of enrollment using error correction codes. This allows only the individual to authenticate and creates a halo2-based zero-knowledge proof at the time of authentication. The created proof is sent to the on-chain contract for verification.This allows the wallet to be tied from the old address to the new address. [Front-End].Built using React. The screen accepts voice input for voice registration and authentication and the data is sent to the backend where it can be checked for the sign obtained during authentication.[Back-End]The backend is built mainly in Python using a web framework called Flask.We also used a machine learning model for speaker authentication called RawNet. This model takes raw speech data as input and outputs a feature vector of speech. This model is suitable for this biometric authentication scheme using Fuzzy Commitment. In addition the ability to use raw voice data as input makes the model more suitable (compared to models that require preprocessing) for creating zero-knowledge proofs of inputs and outputs which was not accomplished during the hackathon but is the future work that we are considering.Fuzzy Commitment is a technique that stores biometric information as a commitment and restores it when another biometric information sent during authentication is below a certain threshold using error correcting codes. This provides an increased level of security.The part of the system that creates the zero-knowledge proof and sends it to the smart contract is built by Rust. halo2 a zero-knowledge proof protocol is used.[Smart-Contract]SolidityThere are two types of smart contracts deployed on Arbitrum: Voice Recoder Contract and Wallet Contract.

      "Despite certain cultural trends and negative sentiments towards digital rights management an artist's best ally for protecting the value of their work is encryption. Play Protect allows artists to truly own their intellectual property and grant streaming or download licenses  to users that meet certain arbitrary artist-defined conditions. Those conditions may be either on-chain or off-chain. Some examples include granting streaming licenses to fans who are followers of the artists on Lens protocol or granting download licenses to fans who own a particular NFT issued by an artist.Play Protect empowers artists to share and distribute their music in a decentralized and sovereign way. By harnessing the power of encryption an artist's music can be published on public channels such as IPFS without exposing their  creative works to piracy or otherwise diminishing the value of their work. Play Protect utilizes threshold encryption so that no single node or centralized entity holds the keys to decrypt artist content thereby reducing chances of piracy and large-scale exploits.In conclusion despite some resistance towards digital rights management encryption can be an effective tool for artists to protect the value of their work. Play Protect provides a decentralized and secure platform for artists to distribute their music while ensuring that their intellectual property remains safe from piracy and exploitation. Through the use of threshold encryption Play Protect enables artists to control access to their content granting licenses based on conditions set by the artist. This technology empowers artists to distribute their work in a more sovereign and independent way reducing their reliance on centralized platforms and allowing them to maintain control over their creative output. The project uses the following:NextJSLit Protocol SDKIPFSAn artist uses the UI to upload an mp3 to IPFS that is encrypted using Lit Protocol's SDK and underlying threshold encryption scheme. The artist defines conditions for media decryption and playback using Lit Protocol's access control conditions and Lit Actions. These conditions can use on-chain or off-chain resources from a near infinite array of sources including dozens of blockchains and any API available behind HTTP.When a fan wants to play media they simply sign a message to authenticate their address and  assuming access control conditions are met the Lit Protocol nodes will return the requisite number of BLS shares in order to form the encryption key to decrypt the media. The media is then finally retrieved and decrypted client-side allowing the fan to play the artist's work.",

      "Solsearch is a CLI tool for semantically searching over Solidity code. Search queries can be written in a custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) that closely resembles the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation that's used internally by the Solidity compiler.",
    description:
      "Here's why and for what solsearch can be used:Highly customizable linters: the DSL can encode simple linting rules.Highly extensible static analysis tools: the DSL can be used to write rules on the fly. Currentstatic-analysis tools require working with the AST directly in a high-level language like C++Rust or Python. The learning curve and feedback-loop for existing static-analysis tool is bad.Security research:A researcher can build their own internal set of rules for common vulnerabilities and patternsthat they notice and run it againt solidity contracts.When a new security bug is found this search tool can be used to query against all verifiedcontracts on chain to find out affected contracts.Language designers: when existing features for solidity gets updated the compiler team oftenneeds to understand the impact of the changes. This search tool can be used to precisely locatedopen-source contracts that use certain language patterns.Fun: I wanted to see how to design a query language to search over Solidity's AST and howpowerful such queries can get. It's in built on Rust and uses some existing libraries (solidity-rs: I had to make a fork of this repo to use it as a library my fork) that has the Rust struct bindings for solc's AST. For the first few hours I was mainly searching such a library. Implementing it from scratch would have been tedious and impractical for a Hackathon. (tweet: the replies to this tweet gave some other libraries.)More importantly functions or the visitor patterns are also needed for building the search tool. In retrospect the visitor pattern implemented in this library wasn't suitable for building the generalized matching engine. In the end I decided to de-scope the matching engine to only work with a few rules. If I were to build this over 2 weeks I'd probably reimplement the visitor pattern to be something more suitable for my use-case.The Domain Specific Language (DSL) was inspired by Semgrep. Solsearch can be thought of as a highly specialized semgrep for Solidity. It understands the nitty-gritty annotations that the solidity compiler internally creates for the program. Working directly with the solidity AST can be powerful as it has plenty of rich details about the language.Once the DSL and the AST could be internally represented it was a matter of building the pattern matching engine for it. For the MVP I decided to just support the pattern matching engine just for the AST node functionCalls. The DSL has support for a few more type of AST nodes but both do not completely support every AST node type from Solidity. Completing this would be a more ambitious project that would take around 2 weeks. The future plans are listed in the GitHub repo.",

      "Shima is a decentralized RPC platform that connects anyone who wants to become an RPC provider by making their blockchain infrastructure available to the world and those who use these APIs access to the blockchain networks every day without having to run their own nodes.",
    description:
      "We believe that running and hosting nodes should not be something limited to classic infrastructure providers such as Alchemy Infura Chainstack etc. since anyone with some knowledge of blockhain development can deploy a node in a few minutes. That's why we decided to make it even more accessible by supporting providers and users in their blockchain development journey. Shima is a decentralized RPC platform that connects anyone who wants to become an RPC provider by making their blockchain infrastructure available to the world and those who use these APIs access to Ethereum and other blockchain networks every day without having to run their own nodes.How does it work? To explain Shima we will proceed in 2 parts first what we have set up for people who want to become Shima Actor (rpc providers) and then we will see the Shima Users part.Today to set up a node on any blockchain it can take you 5min to several hours that's why we first set up a graphical interface installer that allows anyone who only need to knows how to open a terminal to create a node between the available blockchains clients: Ethereum Gnosis Scroll Mantle Celo Taiko...  and expose it on a port of his machine in a few clicks and in less than a minute. This installer generates an url that the provider can enter in his provider space on the Shima interface to make it accessible to the world. Those referenced rpcs by the providers will then be stored on a leaderboard specific to each chains. This leaderboard is very important because it allows to provide the users of these RPCs with the best possible route for their requests. The leaderboard works the following: It ranks available RPC providers based on their response time  quality and availability. It helps users and applications choose the most suitable RPC provider for their needs ensuring faster performance and lower latency. We follow 3 steps to sort it: 1. Data Collection the system collects data on the response time (latency) for each RPC provider. This can be done using automated monitoring tools or by measuring the time it takes for the provider to respond to a specific request such as eth_blockNumber. 2. Ranking: The RPC providers are ranked based on their response time with the provider with the lowest response time at the top of the leaderboard. Users and applications can then choose providers based on their position in the ranking. 3. Update: The leaderboard is updated periodically to account for changes in provider response time ensuring that the ranking remains accurate and up-to-date. This allows users and applications to make informed decisions when choosing RPC providers. By utilizing the RPC leaderboard users and applications can easily be redirected to the fastest RPC providers resulting in a better overall experience and more efficient use of resources. In the future other factors could be incorporated into the ranking system to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of RPC providers such as it's availability it's reliability the actual state it stored the functionability it's errors and disconnections... This leaderboard is then linked to the users' Shima RPC keys.As for the user interface we did not want to complicate things by re-inventing the RPC key generation interface so we kept something very similar to the current RPC providers. The user can simply create a project by selecting the chain he wants to deploy it and giving a name to it and then the platform generates a Shima key that he can use in it's applications and interact with the blockchain world.Like any other RPC provider the nodes performances and user stats will be tracked and displayed in dashboards on the interface. We need to track this data because like other RPC providers we offer paid solutions based on successful request units for both parties. The user can then recharge his account via a smart-contract payment that we have deployed on the Celo blockchain and when he will have exceeded his quota of free requests per month it will be debited and redisplayed to the corresponding providers. This system encourages providers to participate in the network by allowing them to take advantage of their distributions and users to take advantage of this competition by benefiting from the most efficient nodes.With this system we built with Shima we can claim to set up in the future a truly decentralized system where users will be able to execute their queries directly to the most efficient users by updating this leaderboard locally via an SDK for development or extensions of dapps.We believe that Shima is a huge step towards the decentralization of the network without taking into account the centralized RPC provider and their markets. Shima gives users back control of the Blockchain! The Shima project benefits from its diverse and robust technical stack which enhances its functionality performance and ease of use for both users and providers.Backend: The Express application written in TypeScript serves as a reliable and efficient core for the platform. By using TypeScript the code is more maintainable readable and scalable allowing the Shima team to develop new features and improvements faster. The backend handles API requests and manages user and provider data effectively ensuring a seamless experience for users when interacting with the platform.Node Installer: The Bash-based node installer enables providers to quickly and easily set up blockchain nodes reducing the barrier to entry for those looking to become RPC providers. By streamlining the node installation process the platform encourages greater decentralization and a broader range of providers ultimately enhancing the resiliency and performance of the Shima ecosystem.Payment Smart Contract: (address:0x13BB753567Eaf68A760D6e92e52323DC23904765 on Celo) The Solidity-based smart contract ensures secure and transparent transactions between users and providers. By using a blockchain-based approach to payments Shima guarantees that users can manage their account balances and usage quotas with confidence while providers receive fair compensation for their services. This fosters trust in the platform and promotes its continued growth and adoption.Frontend: The React-based frontend offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies interaction with the platform. By employing reusable UI components and efficient rendering and updating processes the frontend enables users to create projects manage their keys and monitor usage with ease. The frontend's communication with the backend through API endpoints ensures a smooth and responsive experience which further enhances user satisfaction.By leveraging these technologies the Shima project creates a powerful accessible and efficient decentralized RPC platform that caters to the needs of both users and providers. The platform's technical stack ensures a secure scalable and user-friendly experience promoting wider adoption and fostering a thriving ecosystem of decentralized RPC services.",

We used the Metamask SDK to connect with the wallet and interact with the smart contracts. We built with Sismo to build the data vaults. Sismo being our key sponsor. We built some new data groups and created 2 template contracts which could listen to any NFT and Token contract on any given EVM chain and aggregate the data.  We used Worldcoin to uniquely identify each person so that no two persons can claim the same rewards. A promotion can be an on-chain condition aggreagated by Alchemy and Token Providers on Ethereum Polygon and Goerli. We have deployed our template groups in Sismo Hub. Anyone can use the data group to whitelist people for any event reward or any on-chain privelages.

    description:
      " MEGAxis creates a new revenue stream for prompt engineers while also making the AI industry more accessible efficient and sustainable.We believe that AI and Web3 together can bring unprecedented changes to the online economy. In the use case of the generative AI industry it will be exciting to create a prompt marketplace on a decentralized chain fueled and sustained by Web3 tokenomics.MEGAxis team observed a huge potential market for prompt engineers in the future. As OpenAI Midjourney and many other AI generative tools have taken the stage recently we see the rampant growth in demand for high-quality prompts that can help train AI models to produce accurate and useful results. However creating effective prompts requires a deep understanding of the nuances of language and context as well as the large language model . It can be a challenging task to craft prompts that are precise and unambiguous. Furthermore developing effective prompts is not a one-time task. As AI models continue to learn and evolve there is a need for ongoing refinement and optimization of prompts. Talents will be urgently needed to craft good prompts.Tokenizing prompts can actualize the potential market. MEGAxis can create a marketplace where prompt engineers can earn tokens for creating and selling high-quality prompts. The better their prompts perform the more valuable their tokens become. MEGAxis can also use Web3 tokenomics to create a community around the platform. For example users who hold tokens could be given voting rights on platform decisions upvote and downvote prompts. This not only makes the platform more fun for users but also encourages community engagement and investment in the platform's success.The industrial value of tokenizing prompts is that it will make the AI industry fairer more accurate and more efficient. MEGAxis creates a level playing field where developers of all sizes can contribute to the industry and earn income from their work. This can also allow developers to build upon existing prompts avoid common mistakes and refine their models to be more accurate. By using existing NFTs and building on them to create more advanced models developers can save time reduce costs and ultimately lead to faster development of AI models.

    description:
      "Motivation:Randomness is essential in many applications. It‚Äôs what underpins cryptography makes sampling fair and generates the unpredictability and excitement we love in games.Problem Statement:Current random generators either require trust are extremely expensive or overkill for a lot of applications. Just as there are many different uses for randomness there is also a need for different sources of randomness.Design Statement:To develop a zero knowledge library that is able to provide trustless verifiable randomness that is free and easy to implement.Solution:MINAmal VRF is a library of functions to allow developers to quickly implement trustless randomness in their projects. Randomness is generated through an amalgamation of hashed secrets from the participating users and cycles to include the previous random numbers as each round of generation is required.A ZK proof is created to verify that the randomness was fairly generated. For on-chain verification the Mina protocol is used for it‚Äôs recursive ZK proof system. A relayer was built to allow the proof to be access from any other chain.To empower developers an SDK was built for easy implementation.Further Improvements:The custom built relayer will need to be replace with MINA state bridge once the MINA state bridge is ready.Provide MINAmal VRF as a serviceBuild privacy features to hide the seedBuild escalating odds function to improve library offering This project consists of 3 key components and 2 smart contracts deployed across 6 different chains.The first is a library that allows people to easily build trustless verifiable randomness into their applications. This library is built using MINA SnarkyJS which allows us to quickly verify the proof using MINA‚Äôs Kim Chi‚Äôs recursive proving system. The randomness that is generated cannot be controlled by any party nor is it predictable due to our custom built Natto Interactive Random Protocol. The Natto Interactive Random Protocol is defined by the following formula:Œ£((Secret Hash‚ÇÅ) (Secret Hash ‚ÇÇ)(Secret Hash‚ÇÉ)) = Initial HashRandom 1 = R((Secret‚ÇÅ) Initial Hash))Random 2 = R((Secret‚ÇÇ) Initial Hash Random 1)Random 3 = R((Secret‚ÇÉ) Initial Hash Random 2)The commitment of an Initial Hash prevents players from changing their secret in subsequent turns as this would cause the Initial Hash to not match in the proof.The second component in this project is the custom relayer. The relayer takes the Proof generated by MINA and provides verification before sending it to the destination EVM chains. The relayer is a temporary solution due to the Mina EVM bridge not yet being available.The third component of this project is a front end game of Texas Holdem to demonstrate the use of MINAmal VRF. The front end is built with a dashboard to display the current Hash of each player and the current random generated. This is shown alongside the Texas Holdem game and displays in real time the backend values as each card is dealt.In addition to the 3 components 2 types of smart contracts have been deployed across 6 different EVM chains. The first smart contract is a universal relayer smart contract which facilitates the receival of the verified proof from the relayer. The second smart contract is an EVM Proof Channel which allows participants to publicise their proof. This channel allows the participants to trustlessly cross verify that the random numbers have not been tampered with.",

Built with a core stack of React ethers.js Material UI and Emotion this service fosters a collaborative environment for DAO communities on Polygon and other EVM networks. This innovative blockchain-based solution ensures transparency and decentralization in recognizing and recording the efforts of task contributors. With a seamless and efficient way to appreciate each other's work our platform empowers DAO communities to drive positive impact and further their mission. We are excited to present our hackathon project which showcases the power of combining modern web technologies with blockchain networks to revolutionize the way DAOs operate. Together let's elevate DAO communities and transform the way they collaborate and appreciate their members' contributions! Frontend: We used React as our primary UI library for building the user interface components. Material UI was chosen for its extensive collection of pre-built components and Emotion for styling making it easier to create a responsive and visually appealing design.Backend: For connecting with the blockchain we relied on ethers.js as our JavaScript library. It enabled us to interact with Ethereum-based networks such as Polygon and other EVM-compatible networks allowing us to manage tasks and record gratitude expressions on the blockchain.Sponsor Technologies: We leveraged Polygon as our primary network which provided several benefits including faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly improved the user experience by reducing wait times and costs associated with transactions.Hacky Solutions: One notable hacky solution we implemented was to create a dynamic system for fetching and decrypting data from the blockchain. Instead of making separate calls for each data piece we used Promise.all to fetch data concurrently significantly reducing the overall fetching time.Integration: The frontend and backend components were integrated using a combination of hooks and custom functions. We used useCallback and useEffect hooks for managing side effects such as fetching data from the blockchain and updating the UI accordingly.By carefully selecting and combining these technologies we built a powerful efficient and user-friendly platform for managing tasks and expressing gratitude within DAO communities.

To set up a main vault connect to Predy Finance (https://app.predy.finance/) with MetaMask approve and deposit USDC.Gameplay Description:ETH Farm is centered around farming virtual mushrooms which represent the fees generated from leveraged Uniswap LP positions. To begin the game players must purchase a plant using USDC. This action is equivalent to providing liquidity to the Uniswap v3 ETH-USDC trading pair and earning fees in the form of mushrooms. Once the mushrooms have grown players can harvest them effectively closing their Uniswap v3 LP position and withdrawing the fees earned as real assets.Technical Implementation:The backend transactions for ETH Farm are powered by Predy Finance v3.2 a leveraged Uniswap v3 LP automated market maker (AMM) system. The Graph protocol is used to support the project ensuring smooth and efficient data management. This unique combination of gaming and DeFi creates a truly composable project that bridges the gap between entertainment and finance.ETH Farm showcases the potential for interactive gaming experiences that also provide tangible financial benefits for users. By leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technologies this project is set to revolutionize the gaming landscape and inspire further innovation in the space. How It's Made: ETH FarmConceptualization:We envisioned a gaming experience that combines DeFi elements with fun and interactive gameplay resulting in the idea of farming virtual mushrooms representing Uniswap v3 fees.Design & Development:Our team designed the user interface and gameplay mechanics focusing on a seamless and enjoyable experience. We integrated Predy Finance v3.2 and the Graph protocol to handle backend transactions and data management.Integration of DeFi Components:We connected ETH Farm with Uniswap v3 LP positions to allow players to provide liquidity using USDC and earn fees as mushrooms. Predy Finance v3.2 a leveraged Uniswap v3 LP AMM system was used to handle the backend transactions for the game.Testing & Optimization:Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure a smooth and engaging gaming experience. We identified and fixed any bugs optimized the platform for various devices and ensured that the DeFi components were functioning correctly.Deployment & Launch:With thorough testing and optimization completed ETH Farm was deployed and launched for users to enjoy. The project showcases the potential for interactive gaming experiences that provide tangible financial benefits and paves the way for future innovation in DeFi gaming.",

    description:
      "Splend is a new microfinance lending protocol which aims to tackle some of the challenges of the microfinance market. Based on market research and also personal experiences of one of our team members (Ben) it became evident to us that this is an important problem worth solving. Specifically based on research only 8% of the unbanked $1.4B actually have access to micro finance and because of the predatory nature of these loans (often ranging from 20%-40%) borrowers often end up defaulting.We think that decentralized blockchain technology can open up access to borrowers who live in capital constrained environments. And we also incorporated a peer-to-peer aspect with interest rates ranging from 0%-3% making it a quality opportunity for borrowers looking to use some leverage to build something meaningful.Keeping the user experience in mind for both the borrower and lender we‚Äôve built an easy to use dApp where borrowers can create a loan proposal in less than 10 minutes which includes specific deal terms such as term length and rate a marketplace where both lenders and borrowers can check out a repository of loans and an instant funding mechanism which transfers the loan amount from the lender to borrowers as soon as the lender decides to fund a project. Borrowers must then pay back the loan within the set term length with their principal + interest.We believe that this opportunity allows social impact focused lenders to invest in people and communities they believe in while giving borrowers access to capital in an ethical way. We used ConnectKit to be EVM compatible and to provide a wallet solution in our application and quickly scaffolded with React NextJS Supabase (backend psql) TailwindCSS and Chakra UI to create our MVP. Our designer Richa created wireframes on Figma for our MVP and SLP (sufficiently lovable product). For our smart contracts Spencer used Foundry to develop test build and deploy our lending protocol on multiple EVM chains. Spencer additionally created complex subgraphs using The Graph in order to read our data from the blockchain. Ben handled most of our frontend/fullstack work and lived in our NextJS project in order to produce a visually appealing and functional user experience.We aggressively prioritized low hanging fruit and shipping over everything. We employed iterative design principles developed processes for team consensus and product alignment and remained disciplined in our focus to develop a sophisticated app backend + smart contract infrastructure in order to remain efficient under mounting time and resource constraints.The Graph provided a solution that allowed for our data-reads-from-blockchain to remain decentralized in a space that continues to develop a dependence on centralized solutions. Our appreciation for their tech grew in profound ways as we spoke to their devrel team and learned more about their offerings.Overall the hackiness and grit is demonstrated through our commitment to excellence and our unwillingness to accept mediocrity. Our project only visually came together in the 11th hour - we had to solve so many non-visual technical challenges that we were not able to focus on the aesthetic until the late stage. Despite this setback we resolved to continue to iterate and recommitted to shipping a functional product that could deliver joy.",

A functionality we had in mind is calling the Lens API to live stream video on demand content from Lenstube embedded into a video player on our website at ufo.fm.This broadcasting concept transforms async content which is normally experienced only individually into a collective social experience. The Watch Party and live community experience can be token-gated. The curation can also be community led. UFO content is produced by live streaming video: DJs music performances podcasts web3 talks and events etc. This will be built on Livepeer. These live streams are minted to a catalog on Lenstube.This Video on Demand (VOD) content can be curated afterwards into a Lenstube playlist which is streaming live to a video embed on ufo.fm. Curating VOD and making it live again.To build this functionality we need to have the ability of creating playlist natively on Lenstube - this functionality is not created yet also Lenstube is not equipped for live streaming on Livepeer yet.Tools used: Lens Protocol Livepeer Lenstube Figma Guild Website BuilderWe didn't get the chance to make this concept live as didn't find a developer to work with our non-technical team.

      " RLN & Unirep üèÜ ETHGlobal Tokyo Finalist YORU is a privacy-preserving DApp for social crypto payment. YORU leverages account abstraction and stealth address to make a token transfer. Token is sent to a one-time address which is owned by the receiver and only known by the sender and the receiver.There are two main challenges for social crypto payment.Anyone can track transaction history.Transaction is transparent and can be traceable on chain if the receiver address is the same. This is not allowed for social payment if anyone other than the sender and the receiver make sense of the asset transfer. In addition anyone can track the wallet balance from the same address.User experience is bad on web3.First it‚Äôs difficult for users to remember wallet addresses. We can remember our friends‚Äô social media accounts but we cannot remember his wallet address.Second anyone who sends an Ethereum transaction needs to pay ETH for gas fees. If a user receives some tokens from others he needs to buy some ETH before withdrawing the tokens.Imagine a scenario where a merchant receives tokens from his customers but everyone knows how much the merchant earned everyday by monitoring the receiving address. Another case is that we do know who participates in ETHTokyo hackathon if we watch the registration address. That is bad user experience  for crypto payment and is privacy compromising.SolutionConsidering the user experience and privacy transfer YORU is designed to offer social crypto payment capability. YORU is an innovation to combine stealth address scheme with account abstraction to offer privacy-preserving wallet.As for privacy transfer a one-time receiver address is generated every time by the sender if the sender knows the receiver‚Äôs public key. If the sender wants to send the transaction to the same receiver again he will generate a fresh receiver address. The nice thing is that this is done without the receiver needing to generate multiple private keys or wallets. Most importantly no one can identify which address is linked to the receiver‚Äôs wallet address.For better wallet experience we leverage DID and ENS for public key registration. User can bind his wallet account with his social media account like gmail twitter line and so on. For example if Bob is in Alice‚Äôs telegram contact then Alice can make a transfer to Bob by querying Bob‚Äôs telegram profile to get his public key. Then Alice can directly send the tokens to a one-time stealth address that is only controlled by Bob. Or he can do the same thing by registering the info on ENS.In order to withdraw the tokens without paying the gas fee we leverage paymaster in account abstraction to sponsor transactions so the receiver does not need to deposit ETH in the one-time stealth address. This is super helpful for user onboarding.FutureThe way our system works is really similar to a UTXO contract wallet. We believe it not only can be used as crypto payment but also is a good wallet architecture design for centralized exchange on L2. YORO is currently available on Goerli tetsnet.In this project we leverageDID to resolve receiver‚Äôs public keyENS (web3)Lens Protocol (web2)Account abstraction (EIP-4337) to make gasless transactionsStealth address (EIP-5546) to create stealth accountsCREATE2 (EIP-1014) to precompute abstract account addressesFor the stealth account part we use umbra-js to create an account with the secret number.Our DApp in composed of four smart contracts.Yoru.solUsed by the sender to send tokens to a CREATE2 precompute abstract account address which is controlled by the receiver‚Äôs stealth accountThis contract mainly serves the purpose of storing relevant information for each transfer so receiver can recover the transfers by scanning the emitted eventsPayMaster.solUsed to cover the gas fee when receiver wants to spend his stealth fundStealthWallet.solThe abstract account to store receiver‚Äôs stealth fundStealthWalletFactory.solA factory contract to create stealth wallet contract",

      " without having to connect your walletUwU Link lets users sign any transactions without having to connect their wallet to a dapp. With UwU Link users can simply scan a QR code (UwU code) with any mobile wallet app which parses the transaction for them to sign directly inside their wallet. This eliminates the need for users to go through the cumbersome ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù flow that defines web3 UX today and instead lets users participate on-chain on a transaction by transaction basis. In addition to a simplified UX this solution better preserves user privacy since dapps have no way of knowing which wallet addresses have interacted with the UwU code.For developers and creators UwU Link eliminates the need to build elaborate dapp sites for one-off projects such as NFT mints token-gated events on-chain votes airdrop claims etc. They can easily socialize the UwU code to their communities via established channels (Discord IG Twitter etc) to mobilize on-chain participation. This is especially useful for IRL events where UwU codes can be shared in-person to collect mint or claim digital artifacts. On our example mint interface we're displaying a QR code that embeds the transaction object used for an NFT mint. It adds an optional webhook URL to the QR code that the wallet can later use to send status updates.We added a QR code parser to the Uniswap Wallet that reads the transaction object and fires a request modal to the user to sign. Once signed and sent off to the mempool the wallet will call the webhook passed through with the QR code and send the transaction hash.Technologies used: next.js react-native ethers",

It is an easy trap for a DAO to fall into where contributor compensation is set up via DAO proposal and some contributors are receiving large or recurring grants but after some time stop delivering work that is commensurate with that compensation. Right now DAOs don't have a good way of holding those contributors accountable to following through on their responsibilities and stopping compensation when appropriate.Our project builds on top of Hats Protocol an open-source repo that enables DAOs to grant their contributors roles represented by ERC1155 tokens.We implemented a Hat-specific version of Mech from Gnosis Guild to give every Hat its own smart contract wallet then attached the Superfluid compensation streams to those wallets. This is HatWallet. HatWallets are wallets that are controlled by the DAO but can be delegated to specific individuals and tied to specific accountabilities.This unlocks three key capabilities:HatWallet gives the DAO control over specific wallets as opposed to relying on individuals personal EOAs. This improves security.HatWallet introduces role-based rewards tying streamed rewards and compensation with a given role rather than specific addresses. This ensures good stewardship of the DAOs resources and enables a more programmable and permissionless contribution-based reward structure.HatWallet connects rewards and signing authority associated with a wallet to specific accountabilities. For example if a facilitator role comes with control of a given HatWallet and a specific requirement for keeping that roles is maintaining at least a 75% approval rating from their colleagues the moment they fall below that threshold they will lose access to the rewards and authorities associated with that HatWallet.¬†We did a short demo of combining HatsWallet with Hats + MolochDAOs for context! https://www.loom.com/share/4ed0155735454b62ba0305dd754eb771 Our project builds on top of Hats Protocol an open-source repo that enables DAOs to grant their contributors roles represented by ERC1155 tokens.We implemented a Hat-specific version of Mech from Gnosis Guild to give every Hat its own smart contract wallet then attached the Superfluid compensation streams to those wallets.Polygon deployments of HatsWallet:implementation: 0x761417B02a5406Ff4e692bC9aB04A7e66C2f5d0afactory: 0x6FE23eEe15eB5aB6Cb6c4D1C6A769e49368cE739Gnosis Chain deployments of HatsWallet:implementation: 0x761417B02a5406Ff4e692bC9aB04A7e66C2f5d0afactory: 0x6FE23eEe15eB5aB6Cb6c4D1C6A769e49368cE739Celo Alfajores testnet deployments of HatsWallet:implementation: 0x761417B02a5406Ff4e692bC9aB04A7e66C2f5d0afactory: 0x6FE23eEe15eB5aB6Cb6c4D1C6A769e49368cE739",

      ' and leverages the composability of NFTs for AA based gas sponsorship.Send an NFT and automatically cover the recipient\'s gas! DayPass allows the distribution and organization of gas sponsorship via NFTs or "Daypasses". We abstract the process of paymaster deployment and leverage the composability of NFTs for AA-based gas sponsorship. Developers can set up restrictions including disabling trading gas limits spending limits and as the name "Daypass" suggests time limits.We believe that paymasters are going to be a core piece of crypto infrastructure with many eventually servicing millions of wallets. Distributing access to these paymasters via NFTs provides a way to organize and track this usage leveraging existing NFT tools. Think of DayPass as an organization and composability layer for paymaster access.Beyond the benefits of organization and composability in addition to the awesome benefits of gas sponsor ship enabled by AA in general the time restriction feature of these NFTs could be useful for a few different use cases:Developer events- Do you want someone to try out your new protocol? Send them 3 days worth of all the gas they\'d want on relevant contracts.- Do you want users to deploy to your L2 during a hackathon? Airdrop Daypasses to all attendees that sponsored deploys and swaps for the duration of the hackathon!Games- Free gas could be a really cool reward item and an NFT "ticket" or "pass"Large Scale NFT based onboarding- A ton of users\' first interaction with crypto is being airdropped an NFT think about super bowl commercials promotions etc. Recent examples of these types of drops include Crown Royal Mastercard Starbucks etc. If these NFTs conformed to the DayPass spec users could sell or trade these NFTs without ever needing to fiat onboard vastly improving their first experience. DayPass is a tool for ERC 4337 based AA which uses NFTs to guard paymaster access. When someone sets up their "Daypasses" they specify a series of restrictions. Once they\'re finished and hit submit we do two three things: Deploy a Daypass NFT contract then deploy an ERC 4337 Paymaster contract stake and deposit on the paymaster. We have a helper contract that handles this it\'s setupHelper.sol if you want to see exactly what we\'re doing!That paymaster contract decides whether or not to sponsor transactions based on the senders\' ownership of a "valid" Daypass NFT. We underestimated how restrictive the verification function on the paymaster is so there\'s a bit of a discrepancy between the restriction functionality shown in the client vs on-chain. You can see HackathonPaymaster.sol for details there. Future work would involve working around these restrictions.We built this with the future in mind where AA is ubiquitous and AA wallets have good paymaster selection built-in. In our demo you\'ll see us input the address of the newly created paymaster when we\'re showing off sponsored transactions. In the client we\'re using ZeroDev AA wallets.

The protocol will use zk-SNARKs and other zero-knowledge proof techniques to protect the privacy and security of the certificate holders while enabling verification of their credentials.It targets a range of stakeholders in the education sector including universities colleges vocational schools training providers and employers. By enabling the issuance and verification of academic certificates and diplomas as NFTs the protocol helps institutions to reduce fraud increase transparency and improve the value of their credentials. Employers benefit from a more reliable and secure method of verifying candidates' credentials while students and graduates have greater control over their academic records and a more secure method of sharing them with potential employers.Saturn can generate revenue by charging a fee for the issuance and verification of SBTs as well as for additional services such as storage and backup of certificate data. This protocol also offers additional features such as analytics and insights on the use of academic certificates and diplomas which could be useful for institutions and employers.How it works -->1/ An educational institution or organization creates a new certificate or diploma and uploads it to the smart contract along with relevant metadata such as the name of the certificate the name of the issuing institution and the date of issuance.2/ The smart contract mints a new SBT representing the certificate and assigns ownership to the recipient.3/ The recipient can now transfer the SBT to their own wallet or keep it in the smart contract.4/ When an employer or other stakeholder wants to verify the authenticity of the certificate they can request access to the metadata associated with the SBT.5/ The smart contract uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the authenticity of the certificate without revealing any private information about the recipient. This could involve a zk-SNARK proof for example that proves that the certificate was issued by the correct institution and has not been tampered with.6/ If the verification is successful the metadata is provided to the verifier who can then confirm the authenticity of the certificate.7/ If the verification is not successful the verifier is notified that the certificate is invalid.8/The smart contract can also include additional features such as the ability to revoke or expire certificates in the event of fraud or other issues. At this stage the concept is still in the proof of concept phase and I have not yet built a working prototype. However I believe that the potential for this concept is significant as it can revolutionize the way academic certificates and diplomas are issued verified and stored securely. I am committed to bringing this idea to life and am currently exploring funding opportunities to support its development.Although I didn't find a developer with the required skills at this hackathon I remain committed to bringing this project to life. I will continue to work hard to find the right team and resources needed to implement this concept and bring the benefits of blockchain-based academic credentials to the world.",

Streamyx combines web2 and web3 technologies together.First we leverage the LivePeer web3-integrated live-streaming system to bring live content to our users. Our app maintains no private server-side state because the only thing that a user needs to keep secret is their per-stream stream key which is issued right before the stream begins.The smart contract is built with a combination of technologies from OpenZeppelin SuperFluid and ThirdWeb and it is scaffolded with HardHat. In the case that someone (e.g. a potential advertiser) wishes to sponsor a stream we use the SuperFluid money streaming API to dynamically send money to the stream‚Äôs host while the livestream is active. Streams will have a baseline attendance rate (40% of the sponsor‚Äôs goal possibly adjustable in the future) above which the money streaming will continue and increase until the 100% attendance rate. Because the money will be streamed dynamically according to attendance sponsors are effectively paying for units of viewership per time while stream hosts are incentivized to not only attract a large number of viewers but keep them watching for long periods of time.The frontend is built in Next.js with some Chakra UI elements and TailwindCSS styling. For the Web3 integration we used ThirdWeb. The contracts are deployed to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.Most of the work on this project went into writing the smart contract and making it as robust and user-friendly as possible.Test it out here: https://streamyx.vercel.app/",

      "This governor extension introduces proposal vote sponsorship to DAO governance token holders. This makes it easier for protocol users to participate in governance which in turn fosters equitability and diversity. It does so by adding ERC-4337 compliant paymaster functionality to the OpenZeppelin governor contract. And because it uses the OpenZeppelin governor it's interoperable with a bunch of existing UIs and tooling. With this extension governance token holders with 0 ETH in their wallet can cast votes on DAO proposals! Future work could include:expand the scope of what can be sponsored (e.g. proposal execution)support more vote methods (currently only castVote supported)give governor a way to punish griefingharden paymaster validation logic include better unit testshelper library for forge users This project is a foundry project written in solidity that imports the @openzeppelin/contracts as well as the Ethereum Foundation's infinitism/account-abstraction contracts. It composes them in a new original contract called GovernorSponsoredVoting.sol.  Tests are written to prove that token holders with 0 ETH in their wallet can indeed cast their vote on a proposal with gas paid entirely by the governor contract's new paymaster capabilities. However there is 1 remaining block.number call (to fix) that prevents the UserOperation from getting included in a goerli bundle.I cut a whole bunch of corners for example:only support castVote and not other relevant vote methodsonly support BasicAccount style executehardcoded paymaster address in trampoline as currently trampoline wants a paymaster url insteadcan currently be griefed by malicious account who calls with innocent calldata but whose implementation spends the gas on something irrelevant. See TODO on blacklisting / reverting in 2nd postOp.I tried to mark TODOs in appropriate places. Would love to keep working on this!",

    description:
      "Accio.NFT combines interchain bridging protocol with NFT marketplaces to create a one-click UX for buying NFTs with cross-chain liquidityBackgroundAs the Ethereum ecosystem expands we are seeing more and more new L2 chains.This means that in order to use multiple products users need to move liquidity between multiple chains. The current UX for bridging liquidity is quite cumbersome‚Äîusers need to swap and bridge tokens from each chain separately.So we thought that there needs to be an easy way for users to collect assets from multiple chains at once and use their beloved products.FunctionalitiesUsers can check their wETH balances on 4+ chains (Goerli Mumbai Linea Optimism)Users can swap USDC -> wETH using 1inch Fusion APIUsers can check the NFTs currently on sale (Opensea)Users can buy NFTs by specifying how much they want wETH they want to use from which chains (e.g. 0.5 wETH on Linea and 0.5 wETH on Mumbai) ModulesSmart contractsThe buy function on the LiquidityAggregator contract is the initial entrypoint that triggers the cross-chain liquidity aggregation and NFT purchase flow:Stores the user's request within the contract storageFetches user funds on the local chain if neededSends interchain messages to the LiquidityAggregators on the remote chainsOnce the remote LiquidityAggregator receives the message it gets the user's funds on the remote chain and calls transferRemote on the HypERC20 token to send them over to the origin chain.Upon a successful interchain transfer the handleWithToken function on the origin chain's LiquidityAggregator is called and if the funds are all aggregated an NFT purchase is executed.FrontendEasily view liquidity across multiple chainsDisplay the aggregated value of various tokens from multiple chains through the 1inch APISupport simple swaps across multiple chains using the 1inch Fusion SDKAggregate and display NFT collection information from multiple chains and marketplaces. Also used opensea.io APIIntegrated with the accio.nft smart contractView your NFTs distributed across multiple chainsTech stackHyperlaneUsing Hyperlane was essential for making our project since we needed both a general messaging bridge and a token bridge. We had fun trying to deploy Hyperlane on a new chain (Linea) and running validators/relayers ourselves.One challenge we encountered was related to relayers--our messages kept failing because the relayer transaction ran out of gas. We ended up digging up the rust code to find out where the gas limit was being set and doubled it to make our transactions go through.Another challenge was modifying the Warp Route default contracts so that it could send arbitrary data along with bridging token. We wanted to use hyperlane-deploy which contains helper scripts for deploying and testing Warp Route but we couldn't use it as given because it was importing hyperlane-sdk as an npm package. We ended up using git submodule to solve this problem.1inchWe implemented 1inch Fusion SDK into our service so that users can swap their assets in the most safe and gas-efficient wayWe used the 1inch quote API to enable a quick glance at the total value of various tokens on each chain.Metamask (Linea)We deployed our contract on Linea Goerli network because we believed that it has potential to become a widely-used L2 chain for NFTs and gaming since it is cheap and is very well integrated with other products such as Metamask and Infura.AirstackWe used Airstack to get NFT metadata and the latest transfer information for each NFT collection",

Existing liquidity provision suffers from low returns due to liquidity fragmentation and high risk due to impermanent loss. Pansy AMM solves these issues by using demand-based liquidity management and a currency basket pool with a pricing mechanism based on market price rather than coin balances in the pool. This makes impermanent loss zero and provides zero slippage to traders for market price. Pansy AMM incentivizes swaps that improve the pool balance and penalizes swaps that worsen it.

      " while building and maintaining its subsequent social graphAs web3 grows we start to see non-financial applications especially those in social reputation and attestation. But as we spend more time on these different platforms our identity becomes fragmented. Predictably we'll likely repeat what happens with our web2 experience where while we are keeping our different identities separated for different purposes we are constantly migrating from platform to platform it becomes challenging to keep in touch with our connections.Wave allows you to express your identity differently in different situations to build and maintain connections through a filterable and portable social graph that is truly yours.Imagine having all your internet footprints in one place but tailored into different identity profiles for different purposes: professional networking expressing your worthiness to join a community getting whitelisted or simply showing off your lifestyle.Here's how it works.Wave aggregates all your on-chain footprints. Then visualise them in a fun and easy-to-understand format. This is only accessible to you.You can drag and drop your information as needed and build an identity profile for each purpose.Build a social graph through each connection you make.Use the social graph to collaborate with your connections.As an MVP we are building a filterable network graph where you can easily search your contact directory for future collaboration. Say I‚Äôm going to [ETHGlobal Lisbon] for a hackathon. I can filter my graph to find a [uiux designer] who is in [Lisbon] or is going to [Lisbon] and are passionate about the [identity] space. My social graph will show the result of my connections who fit the filters. Or if I do not have any such person in my contact but some of my connections do I can reach out to them for referral to those second-degree connections.And this is just the beginning. With Wave your identity will give you so much utility. Other use cases in our roadmap include community CRM where you automatically get a member directory through a simple tag on Wave profile use your identity vault or profile to get a personalised AI assistant. And of course monetisation of our own data the similar way web2 platforms abusively sell our data to brands and businesses. Our application is composed currently of two parts: web application and node. Node is the backend part of our project and it is used to aggregate user's digital footprints to as a basis to build multiple identity profiles and create an associated social graph.This social graph is our magic! Users can query different data points to find their people for collaboration. This query is written in pure SQL and it takes only one query to get all people from your network graph.Our web application is written in React/TypeScript and Wave Node is written in Golang and PostgreSQL for storing user data.We use the following sponsor technologies: Airstack for aggregating on-chain data and Polygon PoS for claiming user handles as NFT it works pretty much like an ENS registry so people have their identities in their hands. Web application connects to our Wave Node to get stuff done. In the future we are going to have a decentralized network of these nodes.",

An NFT is then minted as proof of ownership and locking of the coins which can be used on platforms like Snapshot to vote for different projects.Because the NFT is a certificate of ownership it doesn't require to be in any specific blockchain only on those that the voting platform supports. This enables the minting to happen in layer 2 blockchains for lower fees and efficiency. It also allows users to handle the proof of all the coins they have locked for voting in a single blockchain and wallet. In order to achieve proof of reserve the exchange will create a Merkle tree where each leaf represents that a user has performed a lock on one of their assets. The exchange will then provide the user with the Merkle proof required for verification as well as other relevant information (currency amount the user's personal address and lock expiry timestamp). The exchange will publish the root of the tree to the smart contracts deployed across the different chains they wish to support.When a user requests the minting of an NFT the smart contract will receive the NFT minting call and validate the input using the Merkle proof provided by the exchange. If the validation is successful an NFT will be minted with information about the locked assets such as the currency and amount. This NFT can then be used on any voting platform such as Snapshot.",

      " trustless resume verification for anon devs. Powered by zk-SNARKs Ethereum & IPFS. Showcase skills maintain privacy & prove expertise in a secure ecosystem. Join our mission to revolutionize talent discovery & validation!INTRODUCTIONZKredentials is a decentralized resume verification platform designed to empower anonymous developers by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) Ethereum blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The platform aims to revolutionize talent discovery and validation for job hunters while preserving privacy and ensuring security for job seekers.RELEVANT STATISTICS IN WEB3A survey conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Kraken found that more than 40% of respondents preferred to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym when interacting with others in the crypto industry. The survey also found that privacy was one of the most important factors for respondents when choosing a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet. (Source: Kraken \"Crypto Security: A Survey of Investor Security Habits and Attitudes\" 2019)In addition according to a survey conducted by employment website Indeed job postings in the crypto industry increased by 621% from 2015 to 2018 while searches for crypto-related jobs increased by 1457% over the same period. However the same report also notes that the supply of candidates has not kept pace with the demand for crypto talent. (Source: Indeed \"Bitcoin Jobs: How to Get Paid in Cryptocurrency\" 2018)Another survey conducted by CoinDesk in 2020 found that more than half of the respondents (53%) believed that pseudonymity was important to the crypto industry and that it was a key factor in maintaining the industry's decentralized and open culture. (Source: CoinDesk \"CoinDesk Research: The State of Crypto 2020\")WHY WE NEED ZKREDENTIALSAs we've seen from the data the need for privacy and pseudonymity is evident within the crypto industry. An increasing number of individuals are seeking anonymity in their interactions and this extends to their professional lives as well. This growing demand for privacy in the job market coupled with the rapid expansion of the crypto industry highlights the necessity for a platform like ZKredentials.ZKredentials addresses this essential need by providing a secure and privacy-preserving solution for job seekers allowing them to showcase their skills and credentials without compromising their anonymity. By employing advanced technologies like zk-SNARKs Ethereum and IPFS ZKredentials allows users to generate resumes and verify their qualifications without revealing sensitive personal information.Moreover ZKredentials enables a trustless system that reduces the reliance on centralized entities such as job boards or recruitment agencies. This decentralization empowers job seekers by giving them greater control over their data and credentials. At the same time it ensures that potential employers have access to accurate and trustworthy information about candidates which helps streamline the hiring process and improve overall efficiency.Additionally the platform caters to the unique needs of the crypto industry which is known for its decentralized and open culture. By providing a privacy-focused resume verification system ZKredentials supports the community's ethos and promotes the growth of the industry as a whole.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion ZKredentials is an essential tool for job seekers and employers in the crypto industry. By prioritizing privacy and security the platform revolutionizes talent discovery and validation meeting the unique demands of the industry and helping bridge the gap between the growing number of job opportunities and the limited supply of qualified candidates. As the crypto industry continues to expand platforms like ZKredentials will play a crucial role in fostering a thriving job market that aligns with the values and expectations of its users. The project consists of a frontend built React and Next.js backend with Node.js and smart contracts with Solidity. The frontend draws data from GraphQL APIs including our own custom subgraphs leveraging The Graph.User Authentication: Users log in using their GitHub or WorldID account via OAuth allowing the platform to fetch relevant data using the GitHub GraphQL API or verify their unique human status with WorldID. The system can continually add more modules based on user demand for different credibility sources.User Registration: Users are minted a resume ERC-721 token when they create their profile for the first time. If a user isn't registered yet they will not have an ERC-721. Each user can only have one ERC-721 for each module.Resume Generation: Users can select special criteria unique to each module to build their resume. Taking GitHub as an example users select specific GitHub-based criteria for their resumes which triggers the backend to generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) for each criterion ensuring data verification without revealing sensitive information.Serialize ZK proofs: The generated ZK proofs are converted into a suitable format such as a JSON object.Add ZK proofs to IPFS: ZK proofs are uploaded to IPFS via a client library. IPFS then returns a content identifier (CID) for the uploaded proofs.Store the CID on-chain: A MetaMask transaction is triggered to store the CID in the respective smart contract depending on the module (GitHub WorldID) associating it with the user's Ethereum address. An ERC-721 token is minted for the user. This ERC-721 will enable other platforms to build on top of the dApp since all resume information is stored inside it. Once an ERC-721 is minted to the user it also means the user is registered for that specific module.User Profile: The platform displays the user's generated resumes and associated ZK proofs allowing users to view edit delete and manage their data.Resume Verification: Another user can input the Ethereum address or unique proof identifier to verify a resume. The frontend fetches the associated CID from the respective smart contract retrieves the ZK proofs from IPFS and verifies their validity through the Verifier.sol smart contract.Chat with Anon Devs with Push Protocol: Push is integrated into ZKredentials to allow potential employers to reach out and chat with anon developers after viewing their resume on the app for further discussion.",

      ' inspired by the decentralized autonomous organization of 2016. Investors who participated in The DAO transactions will receive membership NFTs fostering a positive outlook. Members can communicate through Discord-like chats and attend offline events.Introducing TheDAO Reunion a project inspired by the groundbreaking and infamous decentralized autonomous organization that emerged in 2016. The DAO utilized Ethereum smart contracts to enable investment decisions through decentralized governance paving the way for the birth of numerous Web3 projects. However shortly after its ICO The DAO was hacked by an infamous reentrancy attack leading to the loss of a significant portion of its funds. This sparked a debate between those who supported a hard fork to reverse the hack and those who believed in following the smart contract causing controversy within the blockchain community.TheDAO Reunion aims to create a community for the investors. Accounts that invested in TheDAO transactions on the chain will be whitelisted and their owners will be able to mint membership NFTs. Inspired by the culture in the crypto industry where words such as "degen" are used positively this project aims to see the investment in The DAO in a positive light.As an idea for what this community will actually do they will first communicate with each other and participate in a decentralized Discord-like place and they will rank the membership NFTs by the amount of investment. They also plan to hold offline events. A more compliant and safer 2023 version of TheDAO may be born. At first only NFT holders will be able to access the community but it is better to prioritize expanding the community by allowing other users to participate soon after. Additionally they may be involved in some form in 2023 and they believe that there is ample potential for interesting projects to emerge from the bottom up leveraging their intuition about their DAO. It is interesting to consider a movement in which TheDAO and its founders are involved in TheDAO reunion. On the other hand it may become a closed melancholic community. Whatever the case I would like to see the memes and atmosphere that are self-generated. That is what is "Crypto-ish" isn\'t it? I used Thirdweb offered by Alchemy to create the mechanism for connecting a wallet to a browser and minting SBT. The chain used was the Polygon testnet. Additionally using Airstack I extracted the accounts that had made transactions to TheDAO\'s address at that time and verified if the data and the user\'s address being used were included. Accounts that passed the verification process were able to acquire a membership card NFT with the letter "D" and a number 1 2 or 3 in the lower right corner based on the size of their investment at the time.',

They can use DID.eco to launch their domains/namespaces by selecting an ENS domain.DAOs can distribute passcards enabling each member to claim their subdomains on ENS. NFT projects can allow holders to claim TokenID-related subdomains to build global consensus.DAOs including NFT communities can take advantage of ENS's existing infrastructure and out-of-the-box features. Users can send & receive funds or set their primary name to show off their namespace & personal domains on major platforms and wallets (e.g. Etherscan Opensea Brave Coinbase wallet) to raise social awareness.Moreover by leveraging cross-chain protocols like LayerZero DAOs and NFT projects on other blockchains can grant ENS-based domains to their community members expanding ENS's reach. We have also developed a token distribution tool to enhance the platform's utility.It is a win-win solution for DAO and ENS providing unique & unified & widely-supported IDs for DAO distributed to their members meanwhile increasing the demand and user base of ENS. In regard to smart contract development we have built separate contracts for DAO and NFT projects such as ApeCoin DAO and BAYC. We learned from the contracts of ENS and managed to generate appropriate values for node and label hashes for ENS domains and subdomains. DAOs can use our factory contract to issue DAO passport NFTs and related namespaces with a single click without any coding required.Our contracts maintain records for every namespace collection and the subdomains that belong to these collections. These contracts primarily communicate with the ENS controller contract to automatically create and manage subdomains for qualified users who hold related NFTs or passcards. Additionally we have built tools for DAOs to batch-send token rewards to their communities.We used React JS web3js ensjs for the frontend while obtaining data of ENS and NFTs from The Graph & Airstack. We developed smart contracts with Hardhat Truffle and Infura.To help DAOs prevent Sybil attacks we integrated Worldcoin and Lens. Our solution also uses cross-chain messaging protocols such as LayerZero to assist DAOs and NFT projects on other blockchains in launching their ENS-based domains on Ethereum.Sharing the vision of making ENS the universal ID for all platforms we deployed our contracts on ETH Goerli as well as Linea Taiko Scroll Polygon Mantle Gnosis and Celo.Our users can create and claim their unique DAO names based on ENS and use them as primary names on platforms such as OpenSea Etherscan Brave MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.",

This feedback system provides transparency and helps build trust between users as they can assess the reliability of their counterpart before engaging in any future transactions.The rating feature will also help to create a more secure OTC marketplace by deterring fraudulent behavior. Users with consistently low ratings will find it difficult to attract counterparties and may be flagged or banned from the platform altogether.Additionally users can set their own interest rate based on their trust level. By allowing users to set their own interest rates this feature promotes transparency and allows users to accurately reflect their level of trustworthiness. Users with higher trust ratings can set a higher interest rate which will incentivize users to be more professional when they are dealing with customers.Overall the Rate and Trust feature is a powerful tool for creating a trustworthy and transparent OTC marketplace which allows users to make more informed decisions when engaging in OTC transactions. We came up with the idea to rate each other in the OTC market and used Figma to visualize what it would look like. Because of a lack of time we only applied the UI of the new feature.For further improvement Rate&Trust OTC feature would likely involve the use of a database to store user ratings an authentication system to ensure that only verified users can access the feature and an interface for users to view and rate their counterparts.

Future iterations will include other interesting mechanics such as an open-ended prediction market lottery which would provide users with a unique opportunity to speculate on outcomes.

    description:
      "As a member of this hackathon you're likely in the top 5% of DeFi understanding. However even with this knowledge you've probably spent hours wrestling with DApps to use DeFi. Crypto has achieved massive adoption on centralized exchanges like Binance and FTX because of their simple UI. But the decentralized world can never be as cohesive with every protocol being a new language to learn. We need to simplify the user interface to blockchain and we believe the answer lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP).Instead of learning the language of Unicorn website Ghost website Fox chrome extension ect. Imagine if users could interact with this technology like it was a friendly financial advisor. Endlessly patient knowledgeable and trustworthy and able to help construct your portfolio's transactions requiring only a private key's signature for approval.This is the power of combining GPT-4 with blockchain. We believe this is what the future face of our industry looks like. Our project provides a glimpse of this future with a Web4 chatbot framework that includes modular plugins for swapping on Uniswap and streaming on Superfluid. Our project is built using a combination of AWS Lambda OpenAI API React and smart contracts written in Solidity. We utilized AWS Lambda to create serverless functions that communicate with the OpenAI API using specialized instructions tailored to the needs of crypto users and plugins. These plugins include smart contracts written in Solidity that are deployed on various EVM chains. We used tools such as Foundry for testing and Hardhat for development to develop these smart contracts.On the frontend we used React to create an intuitive user interface that communicates with the backend through APIs and websockets. The frontend also connects to Metamask a browser extension that handles transaction signing and interacts with smart contracts. To pass data to the smart contracts we used a custom parsing engine that scans all text displayed on the frontend for special tags that indicate the data should be sent to the smart contracts.",

    description:
      " making them accessible for anyone to invest inOur platform is a blockchain-based bond issuance and trading platform that utilizes smart contracts to enable transparent secure and efficient bond transactions.With our platform issuers can create and issue bonds as digital assets on the blockchain and investors can purchase and trade these bonds peer-to-peer. The platform leverages a decentralized ledger to record all transactions ensuring transparency and immutability.The bond smart contracts define the terms and conditions of each bond including the principal amount coupon rate maturity date and other relevant information. Investors can view and evaluate these terms before deciding to invest in a particular bond.To ensure security and efficiency all transactions are processed automatically by the smart contracts. Once a bond is purchased the investor's ownership is recorded on the blockchain and the bond's coupon payments are automatically distributed to the investor's wallet.Overall our platform offers a secure transparent and efficient solution for bond issuance and trading making it easier for companies to raise capital and investors to diversify their portfolios. We built this project using a variety of technologies to create a functional peer-to-peer bond marketplace in web3. We used the Gnosis Safe SDK Polygon SDK ENS SDK EPNS and IPFS protocols to create a secure efficient and scalable system that allows for the trading of bonds without the need for intermediaries.To begin building this project we installed and set up the necessary tools and dependencies including the Polygon SDK Gnosis Safe SDK and web3.js. We then created a new project directory and initialized a new NPM project.Using the Gnosis Safe SDK we created a new Gnosis Safe to be used as the marketplace's escrow account and transferred funds to the Safe. We also created a new ENS domain using the ENS SDK and configured it to point to the marketplace's front-end.Next we designed and implemented the front-end of the marketplace using a framework such as React or Vue.js and integrated it with the Gnosis Safe SDK and ENS SDK. We then implemented the back-end of the marketplace using a server-side framework such as Node.js and integrated it with the Polygon SDK and Gnosis Safe SDK.We created smart contracts to represent the bonds to be listed on the marketplace defining the parameters of the bonds such as the issuer maturity date coupon rate collateral and credit rating. These smart contracts were deployed to the Polygon network using the Polygon SDK.We also created smart contracts to facilitate the peer-to-peer trading of bonds on the marketplace and deployed them to the Polygon network using the Polygon SDK. We wrote unit tests for the smart contracts and ran them using a testing framework such as Truffle. We integrated the smart contracts with the front-end and back-end of the marketplace using web3.js.To provide user authentication and profile management for companies that want to list their bonds we created a user authentication smart contract. We also created a form for companies to list their bonds including bond details such as name duration interest rate and amount.We used IPFS to store and distribute bond-related content such as prospectuses and other documents. We implemented a search and filter functionality for users to discover available bonds based on their preferences. We also created a system for users to invest in the listed bonds and transfer funds to the escrow account using Gnosis Safe to ensure the safety of the funds.Finally we implemented a notification system for companies and users to keep track of their investments and listing status. The working model was hosted using Vercel or Netlify.Throughout the development process we used various sponsor technologies such as Gnosis Safe Polygon and ENS to build a more secure efficient and scalable system. These technologies helped us to create a functional and reliable marketplace that allows for the trading of bonds without the need for intermediaries.we are proud of the nitty-gritty details of this project including the use of multiple protocols and technologies to create a cohesive and functional system. While we did not do anything particularly hacky we did spend a significant amount of time testing and fine-tuning the system to ensure its reliability and security",

    description:
      ' without censorship.There are four user personas referenced in our project:Publishers - Web 3 community managers who can choose to show ads to their communities as a source of revenue.Advertisers - These users have messages they want to share with website visitors and can pay for distribution of the message.Website visitors - Users whom the ads will be shown.Protocol operator - Provides the infrastructure to facility the advertising between the publishers and the advertisers.The ability to bring in revenue via advertising is an important way for traditional web communities to generate revenue. However Web 2 advertisers and Ad Exchanges have been reluctant to on-board crypto projects. At the same time centralized Ad Exchanges are prone to "demonetization" where the Ad Exchange refuse to montize publishers for various reasons sometimes in a transparent manner.Permissionless-ads protocol lays out the basic foundations for permissionless ad serving infrastructure. For this hack we implemented the following:Ad Inventory as a NFT: Similar to a Supply Side Platforms allowing Publishers to publish their advertising inventory and receive payment for the ads they serveAdvertising Campaign as an NFT: Similar to a Demand Side Platforms allows Advertisers to purchase advertising to the communities they wish to reachWeb3 Ad Exchange Connector: Connecting between on-chain orders and Web 2 Ad ServerPayment Service: Perodically pay out to the Publisher (Ad Inventory) NFT based on the amount of ads they\'ve servedFuture functionalities include:Moderation Tools: Allows Publishers and Advertisers to opt-in to different types and kinds of advertising they wish to receive and pay forAd Formats: Standardized type and formats of advertising that suppliers can offer and advertisers can purchaseBidding & Auctions: Different methods that advertisers and publishers can reach agreement on pricing of the ads and price discoveryReporting: For advertisers and publishers to estimate the value of their NFT and optimize their spend / revenue Our project has 5 components:adUnit smart contract:This creates an "adUnit" as an NFT. An Ad Unit is where advertising can be displayed and where the economic value from the advertising will accrue.An adUnit has an owner and is implemented as a Hilbert Curve to optimize display space and contains information about the kinds of ad that can be shown on it. E.g. the size (200x200 pixels 800x200 piexles) and type (banner video) of advertising that can be shown on the ad unit.The adUnit is typically associated with a web property such as a website.While this implementation associates the adUnit with a specific website it can be abstracte to represent a collection of advertising types and locations that someone can operate e.g. an advertising agency in charge of optimizing advertising revenue associated with multiple collections and properties.Implementing the adUnit as an NFT allows the economics value accrued to collections and properties to become tradable and liquid.campaign smart contractThis creates an "campaign" as an NFT. A campaign is where advertisers will pay money to reach their desired audience.A campaign require the following inputs:Budget: how much the advertiser wants to spend for this campaignCPC: Cost per Click how much the advertiser will pay for a single click or "interaction" from the viewerImage: the creative to be shwon to the end user. This can be abstracted to represent a video sound or some other media typeLanding Page: Where the viewer of the ad will be directed to if they click on the adSize: how big the advertising will be. This can be abstracted to represent how much "inventory" the advertising will take up from the publisher. E.g. their website or just the top banner.An advertiser will also need to deposit their budget into the value. In this implementation we have not required the deposite to be any particular token. But publishers can require that the advertiser pay using any set of tokens such as USDC.Ad Server - Google AdManagerWe leverage the capabilities of the Google AdManager Advertising Server to control for how advertising are displayed and other parameters. This functionality can be moved on-chain at a later date.We also want to demostrate that it\'s possible to bring Web 2 advertisers directly into Web 3 allowing Web 2 advertisers to buy ads using the tools they already know to reach new audiences and formats.dApp front-end - FirebaseThis is an reference implementation of the kinds of ads that can be displayed and how the economic value and be accounted for to NFT holders.The problem is how to fairly distribute advertising space and revenue to NFT holders in a fair way. We want to avoid cases where single NFT holders can "hold up" other NFT holders from receiving advertising revenue by setting a high minimal bid amount.In this implementation via a Hilbert Curve any set of contiguous NFT holders can support showing advertisements without regard for their minting order. This implemention also ensures a certain level of "density" to optimize revenue generation for each NFT holder.Protocol operator - Cloud FunctionWe use cloud functions to observe on-chain events and make API calls to the ad server to insert "orders". Advertisers can start pause and stop their campaigns via smart contracts onchain and the cloud function will sync the state to the offchain ad server.This also acts as a bridge between traditional ad exchanges and on-chain ad serving allowing Web 2 advertisers (and their budgets) to be spend on-chain.',

    description:
      "Motivation:In the past Defi primarily focused on financial gains and losses and users were primarily concerned with their financial performance. However our aim is to transform Defi into a platform that fosters empathy and healing by extending beyond quantitative measures.For newcomers Defi can be daunting and complicated particularly when real money is involved. Our project seeks to create an intuitive tool that simplifies Defi operations and makes them enjoyable for users. Through visualization we offer users clear and comprehensive information about their position reducing their anxiety and pressure.Incorporating gamification into Defi can increase user engagement drive liquidity and expand the platform's user base. Our ultimate goal is to create a more empathetic and healing Defi ecosystem that caters to a broader community of users.Concept:Our project aims to create a tool that connects users to Uniswap v3 in a gamified manner. Our innovative concept transforms the process of adding liquidity into an enjoyable activity similar to feeding a cat. Instead of adding tokens users will feed their virtual cat with food and water which are essential for its growth. As users' liquidity increases their virtual cat will grow larger providing them with a clear visualization of their position.This gamification of the liquidity-adding process serves as a powerful incentive for users to add more liquidity. By providing an enjoyable and intuitive experience our tool aims to attract a broader community of users to the Uniswap v3 platform. Overall our project seeks to simplify and enhance the Defi experience for users while promoting greater engagement with the Uniswap v3 ecosystem.Features:Create your kitten by adding liquidity to Uniswap.Feed water and food to the kitten by adding more liquidity.1-Click to generate the NFT of the kitten. You can have a growth diary of the kitten.Utilize the NFT for further usage with the token protocols you provided.Roadmap:Our project has the potential to extend into various areas and our roadmap for the upcoming phases is as follows:We aim to develop a generative NFT system that enhances the liquidity-adding process. By adding liquidity in different tokens users will randomly generate unique cats with distinctive features. Each cat will be unique to the user who creates it adding a layer of personalization and exclusivity to the Defi experience.Our project seeks to collaborate with protocols that lack liquidity on Uniswap. By utilizing our kitten NFT as a certificate of providing liquidity liquidity providers will serve as the market makers for the protocol tokens. Incentives such as yield-boosting transaction fee discounts or even airdrops may be offered to kitten NFT holders. These incentives are intended to encourage greater engagement and investment in the protocol tokens further enhancing liquidity and expanding the Defi ecosystem. Our project utilizes Ethers.js to connect to Uniswap enabling efficient and secure integration with Metamask. To provide liquidity-related information we leverage the Uniswap v3 SDK. Our frontend is built using React and Create-React-App ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive interface. By utilizing these cutting-edge technologies our project aims to simplify and streamline the Defi experience while also attracting a broader range of users to the platform.",

Slash is executed using the blockhash of each layer2 stored in Ethereum layer 1 so relayers can take on arbitrary messaging between any layer2s. Currently arbitrary inter-chain communication is performed primarily by sequencers in the chain itself but our protocol brings more relayers for this tasks and leads more decentralized faster and cheaper communication since this protocol does not perform verification as long as there is no problem.

      " which introduces a permission-less way to mimic the trading strategies of any on-chain wallet. It ensures real-time execution with an ultra efficient botnet as well as trust-less depositing and swapping of funds.This EchoKitty project is a trustless and permissionless protocol that allows users to copy trade any other wallet address. Copy trading being popular in traditional finance is not a new phenomenon but it has yet to garner significant traction in crypto. Currently existing projects limit users to only copy trading a small curated group of wallets. EchoKitty addresses these limitations and allows ANY wallet address on integrated networks or chains to be copy traded. In order to achieve this EchoKitty utilizes extensive filters which users can set on their copy trade positions. These filters ensure that only the right transactions trigger a copy trade and also help protect the copied user from taking advantage of the copier. After selecting a wallet to copy and adding filters a user can then set an allowance for how much of their current balance should be traded in the event a copy trade is triggered. Once these steps are completed the user will now be automatically copy trading their selected wallet address when triggered. Copy traders on EchoKitty can view their open positions along with their transaction history and PnL.EchoKitty avoids over productization and enables users to take advantage of their on-chain knowledge. EchoKitty doesn't provide users with the best addresses to copy trade. Rather we leave this up to the user while giving them the proper tools and filtering to create their own personalized copy trading positions. EchoKitty achieves permission-less copy trading by combining three key elements:Four smart contracts supporting mainnet gnosis and polygon network for holding funds and executing the copy trades on 1inch (which can be easily extended to any DEX)An off-chain botnet monitoring the target addresses and initiating the copy tradesA react based front-end to request target wallet‚Äôs token balances and provide an intuitive user interfaceAt the basis of the protocol are four smart contracts (1 detailed):A wallet factory contract creating a smart wallet for every user: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x88865532AB232aab74C69FEb0409A00133d053d8The resulting smart wallet contract that holds deposited funds and spins off a sub wallet for each new address that will be copied: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x458dabe0140dacda264718edc317ff4d07f6b288The sub wallet contract that receives the funds allocated to a specific target address listens to the trade data provided by the botnet and executes swaps on 1inch: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x134f52bc06ea1e40552ab5d6a56a77f57e578b2cAn authorization registry which allows people to tightly control the permissions of who can execute the swaps: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xF4277421bDA6a2E1C36b827fbf9F817A8d573888The contracts were created and deployed with foundry.The off-chain botnet for real-time copy trading (2 detailed):Monitors wallets by scanning and analysing the latest blocksIdentifies trades and gathers the relevant trade detailsSends the details to the subwallet in order to executes swapsHosted on FirebaseFront-end built with React / Redux (3 detailed):useDapp was used for web3 integrationsProvides an user friendly interaction with the smart contractsFetches target wallet‚Äôs initial token balance (using Covalent API)Visualises balances P&L and other addresses performance[Important - the GitHub repo link points to our smart contract repo.

      " it ensures fairness transparency & incentivizes more contributions.The Airdropper for Github contributors is a decentralized application (dApp) that streamlines the reward distribution process for Github developers who contribute to open-source projects. The dApp is built using SuperFluid which enables real-time seamless and frictionless payments.The Airdropper for Github contributors consists of two user interfaces: one for developers and one for admins. The developer interface allows Github developers to register and link their Github accounts with their wallet addresses. Once their accounts are linked developers become eligible to receive rewards for their contributions. The admin interface is for the Airdropper who can distribute rewards to pre-registered accounts. The Airdropper can view the contributions made by developers and distribute rewards accordingly.One of the key benefits of the Airdropper for Github contributors is that it ensures transparency and fairness in the distribution of rewards. Developers can view their contributions and rewards in real-time while the Airdropper can distribute rewards based on the contributions made by each developer. This helps to incentivize developers to contribute more to open-source projects which ultimately benefits the community.In summary the Airdropper for Github contributors is a powerful tool for streamlining the reward distribution process for Github developers who contribute to open-source projects. By simplifying the payment process providing transparency and fairness and leveraging SuperFluid technology the Airdropper helps to incentivize and reward developers for their contributions to the open-source community. Technologically Airdropper for Github contributors is built upon:Frontend: The user interface is developed using JavaScript and HTML delivering a responsive user-friendly experience.Smart Contracts: AFGC utilizes Solidity for creating secure efficient and transparent smart contracts to manage the reward distribution process.Superfluid Integration: Superfluid technology is harnessed to facilitate instantaneous and continuous token airdrops ensuring timely compensation for developer contributions.Local Testing: The project employs scaffold-eth a popular Ethereum development framework to streamline local testing and accelerate the development process.E2E Testing and Demo: AFGC utilizes the Mumbai testnet faucet for end-to-end testing and demonstrating the platform's functionality before deployment.",

By improving upon the unknown Brain Wallet concept we aim to bring Web3 to everyone.The goal of BrainWallet2.0 is to improve upon the poorly known \"brain wallet\" concept which has the potential of being the most secure form of storage for one's blockchain based assets when used correctly. However in order to accomplish this user education is of the utmost importance. Despite this being the case it's also an opportunity for improved UX which was also one of our main goals as poor UX happens to be the chief reason for many potential users being turned-off from Web3's many benefits. The other improvement of this brain wallet concept is also the ability to participate in smart contracts. This project was heavily based on MetaMask's source code and aimed to be a simplification of its features and functionality. Despite that being our main technological focus we also relied heavily on a new algorithm devised by one of our team members that utilized the Scrypt Hash function to force \"slowness\" into our security protocol.",

      "Tanuki is a trustless wallet scoring protocol. It uses ZKP‚Äôs to trustlessly read historical on-chain activity to calculate wallet scores. Wallet scores are modular enabling use cases like paymasters with loyalty-based subsidies and lending protocols with variable rates.",
    description:
      "Many protocols require a scoring metric for wallets interacting with them. Examples include 1) credit score protocols which offer different terms to users based on their scores 2) NFT pricing models that consider the wallets' past interactions with the NFT to accurately estimate price and 3) paymasters that determine the amount of gas fee reimbursement for each user. Currently these methods are performed off-chain resulting in centralized less transparent and trust-dependent systems.Tanuki offers a solution to these problems by utilizing Axiom a ZK coprocessor to read and aggregate historical on-chain data in a trustless manner. This enables each protocol to compute relevant metrics fairly and transparently fostering trustless interactions. Tanuki provides infrastructure code for seamless integration into protocols.While Tanuki's approach is broadly applicable we demonstrate its effectiveness through two use cases. First we explore paymasters which typically promise users to pay for or subsidize their gas fees without on-chain enforcement. Second we showcase a lending protocol with custom loan terms offering variable terms based on wallet scores. By leveraging Tanuki's solution both use cases benefit from enhanced transparency fairness and trustless operations. The guiding principle in building Tanuki was to have the wallet scoring done in a trustless and decentralized way. For this reason we chose to use Axiom a ZK coprocessor to support flexible aggregations of historical on-chain data to derive a score in a trustless way and expose this via a smart contract. The score itself is just a uint256 and protocols can choose how to interpret this score e.g. a service offering gas subsidies may choose to interpret this as the percentage of the gas spent to subsidize.We wrote a simple interface in Solidity called IScoreProvider which is the interface for the smart contract that protocols interface with when integrating with Tanuki. This interface has a single function viewScore which takes a wallet address and returns a score for that wallet address (defaulting to 0 for uninitialized addresses).For the circuits that calculate the wallet scores we use axiom's libraries over halo2 a high-performance zk-SNARK proof system written in Rust.Since Tanuki is an almost fully on-chain protocol (with the exception of the ZK coprocessor which runs off-chain) our tech stack is actually quite simple ‚Äì no complicated centralized infra to run ‚Äì once deployed it runs in a fully-managed way on-chain with 100% uptime.",

Writing down your seed phrase and keeping it safe is daunting even for the most sophisticated users. Hardware wallets are also relatively expensive with a steep learning curve making their use unrealistic for most people especially in Japan (which has the oldest population in the world).As of March 2023 over 64% of Japan‚Äôs residents have an IC-chip enabled government-issued ID card (My Number Card). The Myna browser wallet enables Japanese residents to use their My Number Card like a hardware wallet giving them a simple and safe way to self-custody their crypto and send/receive payments with just a few taps of their card.EIP-4337 compliant contract wallets are generated for each My Number Card abstracting away the wallet creation process for users and enabling features such as social recovery. This will empower Japanese residents to securely transfer wallet ownership during any emergency situation. We built our project on Polygon mainnet. Details below:My Number Card:The My Number Card is a NFC-type B card and it stores a RSA keypair.The RSA public key can be extracted from the card by tapping the card to a NFC reader.The My Number Card can sign arbitrary messages with a PIN code and return signature.Wallet generation:User taps My Number Card to NFC reader.The NFC reader sends the My Number Card public key to our Browser Wallet via Web Bluetooth.The browser wallet software deterministically calculates the ERC-4337 compliant contract wallet address based on My Number Card public key even before deploying the contract wallet and can receive payments.Send transaction:Browser requests a signature of the transaction from the contract wallet (User Operation) to My Number Card.User enters PIN and taps My Number Card onto NFC reader to generate User Operation signature.Browser sends User Operation and its signature to Bundler.Bundler sends the transaction to execute the User Operation.ERC-4337 compliant smart contract verifies the RSA signature and executes the operation.",

This pattern could be used for any smart account.How to use Memento:Start by selecting how many Mementos you want to use maybe you give one to each of your parents or to your two best friends.Fill each out with a note could be a short reflection on what each Memento holder means to you or a memory. Touching mementos are much more likely to be kept by those you give them to.Select how many Mementos you need for a recovery to be successful.Send the transaction this will also fund the mod with a small amount to pay for gas in the future Memento doesn‚Äôt require any external gas providers. you pay the gas cost now for a recovery in the future so your recoverers have a gas-less experience.When/if the time comes to recover your account use the Memento app to create the recovery link to send to your Memento holders simply choose which owner to replace and generate the link.Each Memento holder enters their Memento into the app (asynchronously and in any order).Once enough Mementos have been entered the Safe owner will be replaced and the Memento module self-destructs.

We built our module to be Zodiac compatible. When the module is deployed the app also funds it so the gas fees from the recovery process can be pulled directly from the Memento Module.The Frontend is a next.js app that can be loaded as a Safe App and a standalone app. It's built with React and Tailwind CSS.We ran into trouble finding a 4337 bundling service that worked on Gnosis Chain so we built a minimal bundler to allow us to send transactions to the Entrypoint deployed there.",

Join us in sharing the wealth and making changes today.This project combines a browser-based frontend and smart contract interaction to enable users to deposit their coins (tokens) and mint NFTs that prove their contribution to spreading good impact. The smart contract design involves two different parts of the smart contract: the implementation of ERC721 and DonationController.To get started users can deposit their assets to the DonationController Contract and mint their Seed Goal NFT card. They can carve their goal onto the NFT decide on the length of their challenge period and choose address options for donation.The deposited assets will be sent directly to a certain DeFi product that has no risk of losing the number of deposited assets based on pre-established yield maximizing strategies. (We recognize that we should improve the logics regarding capital efficiency!)Users must visit the website and water their Seed Goal NFT to maintain ownership of their deposit. If they fail to conduct what they promised at the beginning they will lose their ownership proportionally to the number of unattended days. (Seeds must feel thirsty!)During the challenge period the seed will grow into a sprout and eventually become a bountiful tree depending on how sincerely the user takes care of it and performs their challenge. The smart contract will count and record the number of times the seed is watered.Once the challenge is finished the deposit will be returned to the user based on their attendance results and the accrued rewards will remain in the contract forever yielding interest for fund operation. We chose the Polygon network to deploy our project due to its fast block time and the abundance of useful infrastructure available on both the testnet and the mainnet.To develop the frontend we used Figma Node.js and React while the backend was substituted by smart contracts based on Solidity. Since our product deals with charities and donations we aimed to minimize the bad user experience that is often associated with blockchain-based services.These include annoying multiple interaction processes and high gas fees that are almost the same as the expected reward from our product design. To address these issues we utilized the Safe{Core} Account Abstraction SDKs specifically the Relay Kit. Our service allows users to send transactions without incurring any fees (gas fees).Furthermore since we plan to make this project decentralized and ensure its stable operation a portion of the yield will be sent to a Safe account. We expect to have our assets in stable coins which we will use to pay for the gas fees associated with the service operation.",

Additionally the Lens API is leveraged to retrieve user profile data providing valuable insights into user behavior and preferences that allow for a more personalized messaging experience.The frontend of the system is implemented using React and Next.js which provide a powerful set of tools for building dynamic and engaging user interfaces. Although initial tests were conducted using XMTP with Lit Protocol it was found that these protocols did not meet the specific requirements of the project. As a result the project was adapted at the last minute to use Push Protocol which provides a more suitable solution for ensuring the system's robustness and scalability.Overall this project serves as an example of the importance of carefully selecting the right technologies and protocols for building a messaging system that is both efficient and effective.

    description:
      " we offer a simple and modulable paymaster to help you facilitate the onboarding of new users and 100% adaptable to your needs using ERC-2535 Diamonds proxy implementation.Mastaa is a project around a modular paymaster.The basic principle is to allow a decentralized application (any application) to deploy a paymaster which will allow it to sponsor the transaction fees of a part of its users for example for new users.The way it works is quite simple: the deployed contract is a proxy (more details in \"how it's made\") which uses a module to match the \"paymaster\" qualification. It is completely customizable and the solution we propose allows teams to implement other modules (or remove existing ones).Before continuing further reading an important information: the project demonstration can not be done in full we can only deploy the contract but we have no interface to test it afterwards. Indeed even if we think that our smart-contract is functional (for the Worldcoin module we can‚Äôt say because we have no way to test it) we didn't have enough understanding of the tools to test it (Trampoline in particular).With a bit more time we probably would have made a more polished implementation. There was also an error fixed on trampoline quite late in the hackathon which blocked our understanding for a while unfortunately (but we don't blame the team for that we know how hard it is to maintain code and deploy features on very recent technologies).After this little disclaimer we can continue :One of the first problems with the paymaster concept is sybil: imagine you are a decentralized protocol and you want to allow new web2 people not to pay their first transaction fees on your platform. You don't want someone with bad intentions to drain the cash you've made available for this by spamming transactions. That's why we have developed sybil protection modules which allows you to choose several ways to make sure that no one can burn all the funds.For this theme we have decided in the first instance to offer a module using Worldcoin. Ultimately it is possible to integrate many modules such as a module with sismoConnect with Gitcoin Passport a module with Lens Protocol (based on a verified user system) ...The application also allows you to choose different parameters to configure the sponsorship including: whether or not to enable immutability the number of transactions the protocol wishes to sponsor whether or not to make the contract inspectable (this allows you to see which modules are plugged into the contract and which are not but it costs a bit more gas) and the address of the owner. Each parameters is in fact a module that can be added or removed as desired.If they wish teams can completely remove modules or develop others based on our reference contract (even if there is only one function left). The contract really allows for extreme modularity to be able to adapt to the needs of each protocol which can choose the modules of its choice.As the modules developed by the protocols will be audited this improves security as everyone will have access to a list of tested and audited modules for their own projects.There are many modules that can be implemented that we could not develop during the hackathon time but that are very interesting and that we would like to implement (or see someone do it üëÄ) here are two of them:Promocodes: you can deploy your customer acquisition funds closer to the end user with promocodes allowing free transactions on your platform. A web2 concept in web3 it can work too. Imagine all the possibilities with codes like this.The possibility to pay with other tokens than ETH (a swap feature in a way). This swap idea is not very original but here is a little twist: to reward their users platforms that create tokens (governance or even üëÄüëª stablecoins) could reward their users by paying part of the gas fee. Mastaa is a short but not so simple story: when we arrived for the hackathon we had an idea about account abstraction but on the first day after a (very) long discussion with the Safe team we realized that it was not at the point we wanted to bring with this hackathon as the idea had already been developed (and well developed).As we also had another idea with this scalable paymaster we decided to develop this one and we found some features along the way.As the ultimate goal is to have this paymaster used by decentralized applications we decided not to make a backend for the hackathon and to do all the necessary operations on-chain. We created a dashboard to allow teams to manage the paymaster once deployed but since we can't test it now neither can the dashboard. Eventually we will be able to implement a more complete management on the smart contract and everything can still work without the frontend.To enable this modularity on deployed paymasters we are implementing the ERC-2535 (which standardizes scalable smart contracts after deployment you can find the documentation here for those who like technical stuff: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). So we spent some time developing this contract which is the basis of our project.The technical stack is : Solidity and JavaScript (with a React framework Nexth).In terms of sponsor technologies Worldcoin technology fit perfectly into our project and is even essential to build serious paymasters because as said above sybil is a big problem that is important not to overlook.Worldcoin allows when users connect their World ID to be sure that the user is unique there is no way around that.We would have liked to build on Sismo as well because Sismo does the same thing with \"proof of humanity\" badges but not only. It is also possible to consider a community creating a badge (a guild) and paying for the gas of its users. To verify that a user belongs to a group we can use sismoConnect. Since we already couldn't test the module with Worldcoin we decided not to implement a Sismo module (which couldn't be tested either).We focused during this hackathon on the modularity side of the paymaster but we also planned to develop a more complete application. The ecosystem around the paymasters is not mature enough and we lacked tools to properly test some of the features of our application.With the rise of account abstraction on Ethereum and L2 partly thanks to the ERC-4337 but also thanks to the work of many teams relayers will take a growing place in the functioning of blockchains and we believe that paymasters are bound to develop and that they will simplify the onboarding of new users while allowing communities to reward their members. We are proud to have been able to propose a very modular solution because we think it is important that each protocol/community can develop its own modules according to its specific needs. Our trials to build modules even if we think they are interesting (otherwise we would not have developed them) are only examples of the field of possibilities offered by this solution. We deployed this solution on Polygon because it can be useful on this chain too.",

For example this allows anyone to check that an LLM prompt was indeed sent to ChatGPT as opposed to Anthropic Claude.They can then verify that the traffic was actually with the service they asked for and that the values they received indeed correspond to what was actually exchanged.In summary we solve both open verifiability of oracles and duplicated API calls for bringing Web2 data into the blockchain by harnessing cryptography and a novel trustless system architecture.Here is a demo: https://youtu.be/D2FbvB9jmYI (in case the upload on this website doesn't upload in time). Web322 consists of four services - an SDK for on-chain clients an off-chain worker a CRUD backend and a frontend for interfacing with the above. The smart contracts can be readily deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet and several leading Layer 2 chains:  Taiko Polygon Scroll Alfajores Chiado and Mantle as well as the Sepolia Testnet.Users can go to our website and create an account. They then generate a secret key which will be used to encrypt their API requests. The framework of choice is React with Tailwind for styling.Our SDK provides templates for creating smart contracts using our service. They interact with an oracle by asking it to make API calls and receive the call outputs plus a verification hash. The oracle then emits an event with this request which is picked up off-chain by the worker.After this the actual call is made. The worker stores on the backend a dump of the TCP traffic between it and the API endpoint. The communication is via the HTTPS protocol which uses Transport Layer Security to prevent tampering from bad actors. It involves a handshake process between the worker and the endpoint for generating a secret string and encoding the traffic with this string. This prevents tampering with the traffic as it is in cyphertext. For additional security the traffic dump is hashed and returned to the user on the blockchain alongside the call result. For cases where an API key is used (e.g. to query Large Language Models) users have the option to further encrypt the dump using their API key.The user can then check that the hash of the published dump matches the results he received that the published dump indeed involved the server he wanted to communicate with and that the public dump is a valid HTTPS exchange.The CRUD backend provides endpoints for communicating with the other services and stores the dumps and hashes of the responses and requests in a database. It also keeps track of registered users by interacting with the frontend.We developed our code in a GitHub org where the functionalities are subdivided amonst 4 repositories whose names we chose to be self-explanatory.",

What makes our platform unique is that it features physical items that are tracked and verified on the blockchain. Merchants who wish to list their products on our platform must go through a verification process using Polygon ID to receive a Verifiable Credential. Once verified they can use the platform to host a lottery for their product. Buyers can then participate in the lottery by paying with cryptocurrency. The winner is selected using Chainlink VRF which is a secure and tamper-proof random number generator. When the lottery is over the winner can claim their prize by signing the transaction with their wallet to ensure they have received the item before the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.Our platform is powered by Web3 which is a set of protocols and tools for building decentralized applications. We used Polygon ID to verify merchants and ensure the authenticity of their products. Chainlink VRF was used for the random selection of winners in our lotteries. Smart contracts are used to manage the flow of products transactions and lottery results ensuring the entire process is transparent and secure.In addition we believe that our platform offers a more sustainable solution for product lotteries. By leveraging the blockchain to track and verify physical items we can reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of lotteries. Overall our platform offers a unique and innovative solution to the problem of unfair product lotteries and we are proud of what we have accomplished so far. Our platform is built using a combination of Web3 Polygon ID Chainlink VRF and smart contracts. We used the Polygon network for its low gas fees and fast transactions. To ensure the authenticity of products we used Polygon ID to generate Verifiable Credentials that are required for merchants to list their products on the platform. We leveraged Chainlink VRF to ensure the selection of winners in our lotteries is random and tamper-proof. Our smart contracts are used to manage the flow of products transactions and lottery results ensuring the entire process is transparent and secure. As for hacky solutions we used a clever mapping algorithm to ensure that the random numbers generated by Chainlink VRF are mapped to the remaining prizes in a fair and efficient way.

Sismo Connect ensures their identities remain private while facilitating secure wallet interactions. The multisig feature provides an additional layer of security requiring multiple approvals for transactions to be executed.In order to gate we use Sismo Verifier and use it in addOwner function. addOwner function is basically become a authorized contract for changing proxy and call addOwnerWithThreshold function in OwnerManager.sol. Then verified(thanks to Sismo) user becomes a multisignature signer. Also threshold can be changed optionally.Next StepsMango also introduces a seamless airdrop system for rewarding contributors. Moderators can create token airdrops and Contributors can then claim their rewards using Sismo Connect ensuring their privacy is maintained throughout the process. The platform integrates with an ERC-20 token smart contract for efficient token distribution.By combining privacy security and convenience Mango aims to revolutionize financial management and rewards distribution in the GitHub ecosystem fostering a more collaborative and engaging environment for open-source projects.

    description:
      "This project builds upon account abstraction enabling users to seamlessly automate future actions for their wallets.Each account consists of two distinct actors: the owner who is the user themselves and a bot.The owner grants the bot permission to perform a specified range of actions which are executed according to a predetermined schedule and interval. By automating these tasks the bot efficiently carries out the owner's desired actions without necessitating the owner's intervention moving forward.The system is non-custodial as funds remain solely in your wallet. Furthermore it is permissionless as the bot can only perform actions explicitly permitted by the user. This project utilizes ERC4337 (Account Abstraction) and extends its contract functionality. We override the validateSignature method to accommodate signatures from both the owner and the bot ensuring the signer's identity is recorded. Later during the execution process we permit only the authorized actions for each party according to their respective schedules while allowing the owner to perform all actions.Our client incorporates the Account Abstraction SDK and we use StackUp as our bundler. The contracts have been deployed on both G√∂rli and Polygon Mumbai networks. The rationale behind deploying on Polygon is the reduced gas costs associated with highly active bots. We believe that for intricate bot strategies affordable gas prices are crucial.We implemented a somewhat hacky solution for our bot script by overriding node modules and committing the node modules to the repo.Our unique use case required account derivation from the owner's keys while obtaining signatures from the bot's keys.We had to override the getAccountAddress method within the Account Abstraction SDK to achieve this.",

An on-chain game means all logic and state is controlled by smart contracts.  It is being used by multiple on-chain game projects.https://github.com/latticexyz/mudEmjoimon is the example project provided by Lattice to demonstrate how to use the framework and help onboard new projects. The game represents the player as an emoji moving around am emoji based map and encountering monsters for Pokemon style battles. It supports multiple players in the same word.https://mud.dev/tutorials/emojimon/This project is about taking the existing React 2D browser game and giving it a fully 3D rendered browser frontend by integrating MUD with Unity for the first time. The game logic already existed as an open source MUD2 example rended purely in React so the feature being demonstrated as part of the hackathon is the integration of Unity3D which is rarely seen in block chain projects.MUD is frontend agnostic framework for building composable on-chain games and provides libraries for frontends built in React and to a lesser extent Phaser. There is no provided Unity interface.The lack of a MUD-Unity interface is a barrier to MUD and on-chain games more generally being adopted by many potential game development projects.This project demonstrates that its possible to create a Unity frontend for a MUD based game project. The underpinning blockchain framework is MUD2 an EVM compatible framework designed for making fully on-chain games where all logic and state are held on the block chain. The presentation layer for this project is Unity3D targeting WebGL. The hackathon centred around integrating Unity3D with MUD2. We are loading the Unity3D layer via a React wrapper and incorporated glue code to facilitate the communication between Unity3D and MUD.The two project team members are part of the Playmint team building a fully on-chain open-source game. Code named DawnSeekers it has a mixed Unity and React frontend built on a custom on-chain game framework called COG.https://github.com/playmint/dshttps://github.com/playmint/cogLessons learned from Playmint made it possible to execute this project in two person days but no part of DawnSeekers  code was directly used.The game is deployed to a Foundry Anvil chain and has been tested running on a local instance. With not much further work to et up the deploy config it could be deployed to any EVM chain.",

The user will access the protocol with their wallet address and verify the credentials then the information will be written on a SBT that is minted to connected address. The minted SBT can be used in other protocols as means of verification which can be easily integrated or it can simply be a token which you can put on your profile representing your credentials. The frontend is composed of Next.js. Frontend interacts with WorldAPI and after it has been appreciated it will pass the credential to backend. The backend uses Express. Backend mints an SBT and interacts with Push-protocol creating a chat group The SmartContract for SBT is ERC721 with transferability disabled.As an integration case with existing platform we have created two examplesAn ERC-20 token that can only be minted transferred and sold/bought in Uniswap V3 among those who has been verified with World ID.

    description:
      ' and it also creates an incentive for NFT traders to bridge their NFTs from L1 to L2. We are trying to solve the following two problems faced by today\'s NFT market:Low liquidity: The NFT market needs more buyers and sellers. Our protocol creates more "buy orders" in the market.No incentives to bridge NFT to Layer2s:  The gas cost on Layer2s is much lower than Ethereum. However most NFT tradings still happen on Ethereum because people have no incentives to bridge their high-priced NFTs to layer2s. Our protocol creates an incentive by creating "buy orders"  that may have an offer price higher than the floor price on Layer 1.There are three roles in our protocol:A box minter is a layer2 user who pays to mint a box which is an unrevealed NFT. After the box reveals the box minter may get a blue chip NFT worthing much more than he paid or a "penny" NFT worthing less than he paid or even ethers in return. Under the hood by selling boxes to the minters our protocol raises money to buy other NFTs (blue-chip ones and penny ones).A keeper (arbitrage bot) is an NFT trader who sells NFTs to our protocol. For Layer1 NFT collections  the keepers must first bridge their NFTs to Layer2. The keepers are willing to do so because our protocol can offer a better price to the keepers than Layer1.  Roughly speaking the better price to the keepers comes from the fact that some box minters are losing their money or paying for an opportunity.A pool creator creates pools. A pool creator shares the protocol fee generated from the pool. He must try his best to ensure all the boxes from the pool will be minted. ProtocolRolling out so many codes in a limited time without Github Copilot is impossible. Big shouts to GitHub copilot! I love it!If we don\'t go cross-chain our idea is not difficult to implement for an experienced solidity dev. However the cross-chain part adds a lot of complexities:We have built a simple NFT bridge upon the underlying polygon ZKEVM bridge. The NFT address on Layer2 is deterministic based on its layer1 contract address. ( here\'s how we implement it )We have built a VRF on polygon ZKEVM. It is implemented in a "commit-reveal" scheme: (1) a user requests a seed for an L2 app by interacting with our L1 seed provider contract. In that contract we will decide the number of a future block (the target block) of which the randao reveal is the seed. The request will also be sent to the L2 app. When the L2 app receives that request the seed will be committed.   (2) When the latest L1 block number exceeds the target block we can supply the RLP encoding of the target block header to our L1 seed provider contract. The seed provider contract will verify the validity of the provided block header and extract the randao reveal from it. Of course it will send the seed to the L2 app.   (See how we implement it ) . We use this VRF as a seed to shuffle our buyOrders(i.e reveal the box).To use the polygon ZKEVM bridge you need to "bridgeMessage" on one chain and "claimMessage" on another. We don\'t like the two-step UX. So we build a simple script to automatically "claimMessage."  But we don\'t have time to implement the logics to charge the user on the source chain. ( Here\'s how we implement it  )Although we have done a lot of work on the cross-chain part we did not have time to work on the UI for the bridging part.  However all the NFTs used for the demo are bridged from L1 to Polygon ZKEVM.AppLess is more.Since this is a 2C project and we only have 36hr to implement it if don\'t have to no UI framework no backend no database no intruducing anything else out of our goal make sure users can reach each important design of the project first whatever it costs in the performance whatever how dirty the behind logic is.From the APP side I prevent myself from hacking with just skipping or deleting the logic that attracting me to dive into bcz hacking the overall process intead makes me happier nowTech Management && limitedOur team is made up with 1 solidity dev + 1 rust dev that we like the rust toolchain more than the ts/js toolchains for Ethereum but somehow we finally decide everything in ts/js just because it can make our development speed faster indeed.Gather everything in 1 repo working seperatly first and sync at last.',

To encourage people to use these strategies more publicly we will implement a private withdrawal functionality.The Structured Products vertical in crypto is still nascent and the underlying infrastructure has yet to be developed. The yields of structured products must become sustainable and scalable in relation to assets under management (AUM). With that said the future of Structured Products appears bright and we believe that protocols capable of promoting transparent and verifiable risks and returns will ultimately succeed. We have constructed a 4626 vault contract and integrated it with AAVE LENS 1INCH zkBOB and Secured Finance. For the front end we utilized React and we employed Vercel for seamless deployment.Our primary focus was not on developing the best financial strategies but rather on creating a more generalized vault deployment that can be reused in the future if our ideas are validated during this hackathon.We are proud to acknowledge that all code and ideas were conceived at the beginning of this hackathon and we are pleased with our progress thus far.

      "This project implements state channels in a completely novel way: using recursive ZK-Snark proofs. Like the Bitcoin Lightning Network it allows for near-instant transactions at virtually no fees. Users trade between themselves directly over a P2P network and with the security of a recursive ZK-Snark Proof (üòé) be able to close their channel and finalize their balances whenever they want.The project runs on the Mina Network but it can pretty easily run on any other chain that supports recursive ZK-Snarks using SnarkyJS.User flow:A user deposits funds to the Lightning Protocol's smart contract (any token may be used). This locks the funds for a specific period of time. As long as the funds are locked the user may transact with other users of the Lightning Protocol off-chain by simply passing a recursive ZK-snark proof back and forth. That means no on-chain transaction is performed but the user can be sure the money sent to them cannot be forfeited from them.When the user is done trading over Lightning she can post her recursive proof on-chain and receive her funds on the actual blockchain. That means a million trades can be compressed into a single transaction paying only a one time fee.The ZK-Snark proof is smart enough to fail when balances reach 0 or when there's a double spend so users can be confident that they can always post the proof to finalize their trades. The project is based on SnarkyJS a Zk-Snarks library that converts typescript into provable circuits. It is the circuit language used by the Mina Network and the smart contracts are deployed to the Berkley testnets.I greatly enjoyed the dev tooling that the Mina Team has created for spinning up ZK-Apps. I used it to create the Lightning Protocol implementing two main contracts: one is a sample token contract for the mina network and the other is Lightning Protocol smart contract that implements fund locking proof verification withdrawal the various witness verification logic for verifying and setting Merkle root state and the ZK-Snarks recursive proof that I created which enables this novel state channel solution.",

      ' a sacred place for Japanese people and the culture of "Ema (wish tags)"and "Intoku (secret charity)" was developed.The aim of this project is to encourage people who have no previous experience with Ethereum or Metaverse to take the first step.Both Ethereum and Metaverse have the problem that "beginners don\'t get involved easily".A common characteristic is the unusual nature.For many people neither Ethereum nor Metaverse are rarely involved in their daily lives.In other words a special trigger is needed to step out there.On the flip side unusual times and spaces can be the gateway to those worlds.For this project I considered "shrines" as such a special place.Shrines are familiar spaces to Japanese people but they are filled with a sacred and extraordinary nature.However creating a "Meta-shrine" and gathering people there as many companies do does not solve the above problem.The problem is that people do not come there.Rather the breakthrough lies on the side of real shrines.Instead of using Metaverse and Ethereum to get people to come to the shrine we should put them in a place where they can spread out from the shrine.Specifically "Ema (wish tags)" used at the shrine is used as a point of contact to familiarize people with "their own personal Metaverse space.The image is that of a virtual souvenir.Think of a frame for a commemorative photo.Since Metaverse is made of digital data it is actually easy to duplicate.Take full advantage of this characteristic.The gateway to Ethereum is also planted there.In Metaverse space of this project we will place links to sites where you can donate in Ethereum.It would be nice to have a form where users can choose where to donate.But why donation?It has to do with another unique custom of Japanese culture "INTOKUÔºèÈô∞Âæ≥Ôºösecret charity".Japanese people prefer charities that are done in secret to those that are overtly charitable.Overt charity makes the person who does it stand out but only God knows about the charity that is done in secret.It is considered more dignified to be known only to God.Also both have a quid pro quo but overt charity is characterized by an immediate and small payoff.On the other hand charities that are done in secret are believed to have a large payoff much later.Sometimes the payback is not to oneself but to one\'s offspring.Because of this belief Japanese people attribute their happiness to their ancestors.The link to the donation site placed in Metaverse space is the entrance to "INTOKUÔºèÈô∞Âæ≥Ôºösecret charity".It is a device for circulating good deeds just like a money box in a shrine.In other words if you do good deeds the wishes on Ema (wish tags) will be more likely to come true.The above mechanism will also provide an opportunity for foreign tourists to experience Japanese culture in depth.When they return to their home countries they will be able to talk to their family and friends with their own Metaverse space.I hope that good deeds can be circulated using the Metaverse and Ethereum. The most unique aspect of this project was not so much the "technology" itself but the idea of utilizing the characteristics of the technology.In fact I did not use a particularly large technology but a combination of smaller technologies.The platform I selected for Metaverse was Spatial.I was attracted to Spatial because of its ease of manipulation and scalability of spatial decoration and because it is easy to duplicate an entire space.Many Metaverse projects try to create the only luxurious space and bring lots of people there.However since the Metaverse is digital data its true potential lies in the ease of reproduction.It is closer to the invention of printing technology than to the creation of a masterpiece.It is more like Johannes Gutenberg than Leonardo da Vinci.This project is based on that "familiarity with reproductions".Since the main goal of the project is to attract beginners familiarity is a very important factor.A magnificent work of art can overwhelm the viewer but it can also be inaccessible.On the other hand a souvenir that an individual can take home will bring smiles not only to the individual but also to those around them.Metaverse space of this project can be described as a "virtual souvenir".The space itself was created using Blender not a Spatial template.Tatami mats and torii gates are objects unique to Japan.They do not exist in the current template.The background was created using AI (Blockade Labs).The scenery is linked to the cherry blossoms in the 3D object.In terms of using Ai I used BlueWillow to draft the logo.The resulting image was traced in Illustrator.And as for translation I utilized DeepL and the reading was done by ondoku3.Without those services the work on the explanatory materials would have been extremely difficult.One by one similar services exist for each technology.However depending on how they are combined they can be unique.Above all I think it is important to have a conception that takes advantage of the characteristics of each technology.One of the most notable technical aspects of this project is that I focused on the "ease of replication" of Metaverse.And in order to take advantage of this benefit it is important to take advantage of the characteristics of each technology.I hope that many people will be exposed to Ethereum and Metaverse through this project.',

      " an account marketplace enables trading of non-tradable assets with ownership transfer using ERC-4337 creating new value streams for users. Trade whitelist spots or early vesting wallets and find your ideal wallet to easily adapt to the web3 ecosystem.[ Addressing Data Sovereignty Challenges in Web2 and Web3 ]The sovereignty of data has always been an issue especially in web2 where trading game and SNS accounts are forbidden by service terms but still creates significant market. Account holders only hold a limited license and the account belongs to the company. Your account actually belongs to the web2 company! In web3 tradable assets like fungible and non-fungible tokens have gained some sovereignty but non-tradable things still have untapped value.[ 0xMarket: Unlocking Value through Tradable Assets and Ownership Transfer ]Thanks to ERC-4337 and account abstraction 0xMarket enables trading of non-tradable assets by transferring ownership. Our platform offers several benefits including the creation of new value streams such as trading of whitelist spots or early-stage investor wallets. Additionally it helps users quickly adapt to the ecosystem by finding their ideal wallet. For instance if a user wants to play a web3 game that requires a different set of NFTs and levels to play they can buy a game account to kick-start the game. This new incentive also provides original users with additional motivation to put in more effort and contribute to the game.[ Ensuring Ethical Trading and Asset Differentiation in a Decentralized Marketplace ]To prevent adversarial use cases like trading identity-related assets listing accounts must burn credential-related assets before listing on our platform. Ethical concerns regarding transferring credential assets stem from the contract account itself not our platform. Due to the nature of transferable ownership it's crucial for the community and service providers to differentiate between assets issued to a contract address and those issued only to EOA. As a decentralized marketplace we won't determine which assets can be traded; instead the issuing service should make that decision. Our product is primarily composed of two parts: the contract side and the web side. For the contract side we utilized Solidity and employed Hardhat for compilation deployment and testing. We implemented the Account Marketplace using OpenZeppelin as an open-source solution. The TradableAccount implementation involved adding a changeOwnership function to the SimpleAccount originally developed for Account Abstraction by Eth-Infinitism. We ran a bundler node on Stackup to verify if the contract account created using ERC-4337 properly handles user operations.On the web side we began the project using the Create React App (CRA) toolchain. We adopted Ethers JS and Wagmi.sh libraries as the blockchain core libraries. For styling we used Emotion styled components Tailwind CSS and Twin.macro. We developed components using Storybook and implemented a mock server library called MSW to enable the demo to run without a backend. As a substitute for a database we used browser local storage. We enforced consistent code style using Lint and Prettier and managed Git branch conflicts by allowing only rebase and fast-forward merges.We utilized Adobe Stock for illustrations and open-source resources like Noun Project for icons. For components we were able to intensively design using design systems distributed by other people on the Figma community and pieced together to fit our needs.We utilized three sponsor technologies: UMA Airstack and Push Protocol. We integrated UMA's optimistic oracle to verify statements not queried by our platform enabling the use of human double-checking when necessary. To query on-chain data for an account we used the Airstack API. We also added the Push protocol to notify sellers when an item has been sold further enhancing the user experience. These sponsor technologies significantly benefited our project by providing essential functionality and streamlined processes.",

Signers can add wishes to the pool and pay wish power to bless them making consensus wishes visible to more people.We believe the future's new world is driven by beautiful wishes.As we live in an era of deepening global disorder globalization which should bring people together appears fragmented. When we say \"we want to build a better world\" what specific realities do these wishes point to? How can our beautiful wishes guide the construction of public goods and bring imagination into reality?Declaration SignatureWe've created a declaration \"The Wishing Pool: A Trigger to the Social Callings\" representing our powerful call for a better world as the smallest entities in society. We hope to summon every citizen with social imagination to sign this declaration conveying our shared attitude towards the future. This signature symbolizes our belief in building the world we hope for with our imagination and will. We'll display all signatories' souls under the declaration to influence the world together.Wishing PoolAccompanying this declaration we're building a community infrastructure system called Wishing Pool providing public wishing pool services for like-minded communities. It helps communities spark collective wishes from citizens. By coordinating communities members and wishes the Wishing Pool allows citizens to openly express their desires and receive blessings for beautiful wishes establishing a treasury to realize these wishes and allowing shared aspirations to emerge spontaneously from the community. The Wishing Pool is a plaza where everyone can voice their social calls and harvest blessings and echoes.Mint NFT to Become a WisherIf you want to truly participate in building a wish-driven community you can choose to mint the \"Wishing Pool: Summoning Society into Being\" declaration NFT - Wisher. This represents your true entry into the Wishing Pool family. When you obtain the declaration NFT you also gain the influence to bless wishes‚Äîwish power. Wish power is a blessing for wishes drawing more attention to wishes that resonate strongly with you and granting them higher legitimacy.Starting from Individuals and CommunitiesAs independent individuals who love this world even if we can't shake deep-rooted maladies alone we still retain the ability to imagine a better society. This precious imagination can guide us to like-minded people and build a comfortable environment. In Zuzalu we see the possibility of a better society created by individuals and communities becoming a reality. We believe every citizen has a beautiful vision for the future world.The emergence of Bitcoin or the birth of the network nation narrative both stem from an individual's call in response to reality. This social call attracts more like-minded people to join slowly forming their own community which over time will gather the strength to change the world. We have developed a web-based user interface that showcases the project's declaration while integrating off-chain signature functionality and on-chain NFT minting capabilities.Upon signing the declaration users can submit their wishes through the platform which will then be added to a dynamically updated wish list.The process of minting the declaration NFT concurrently awards users with ERC-20 Wishing Power tokens.Users have the ability to allocate their Wishing Power tokens to specific wishes effectively increasing their priority and ranking within the system.",

Comparisons are made using AI for both image and text information.Furthermore by converting prompts into NFTs a system is in place that distributes revenue not only to the primary buyers but also to the sales made by those primary buyers. This ensures that the creators of the prompts receive appropriate profits for their inventions. We developed a smart contract compliant with ERC1155 using Remix. We utilized NFT.Storage as external storage. To enable trading on OpenSea we used the Polygon test network Mumbai. We also deployed on Scroll's test network Scroll Alpha Testnet. There were no issues in dynamically changing the deployment destination via MetaMask.The client was built using Next.js TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Asset images were created using StableDiffusion. We adopted NLP(Natural Language Processing) AI for evaluating the similarity of prompts. We devised a way to prevent the minting of similar NFTs based on the similarity of prompts.

      "Funding a smart contract in a group can be a way to save money because it allows multiple individuals or entities to contribute to the contract's initial funding or ongoing expenses reducing the burden on any single contributor. This approach can be especially useful for decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on smart contracts to function and require funding to cover expenses such as gas fees hosting costs and developer salaries.One popular way to fund a smart contract in a group is through a crowdfunding campaign where contributors pool their funds together to support a particular project or initiative. In this model contributors typically receive some form of reward or incentive for their contribution such as tokens early access to the platform or other perks.Another approach is to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which is a group of individuals or entities that come together to collectively manage a project or resource. DAOs typically operate using smart contracts and distributed decision-making mechanisms to govern how funds are allocated and decisions are made. DAOs can be used to fund smart contracts as well as manage ongoing expenses and operations.In both cases the key benefit of funding a smart contract in a group is that it allows for greater participation and collaboration which can help to distribute risk and reduce the costs associated with supporting a decentralized application. Additionally group funding models can help to promote greater transparency and accountability as contributors have a shared stake in the success of the project and are incentivized to ensure that resources are used effectively. This project is a website built with ReactJs as a framework and using Tailwind Css Daisy UI components at the Front End and Smart Contracts Written in solidity.

      " artists can register their works for derivative creations and earn customised charges. Users can also fuse multiple NFTs to advance the attributes images or data.NFTs have been a sought-after and trendy field in the blockchain venue but their potential remains largely untapped due to limitations on copyright protection. At PolyNFT we believe that the key to unlocking the full potential of NFTs is to enable copyright usage of these unique assets in the first place. That's why we're creating a platform that enables derivative works of NFTs with copyright usage attached.With PolyNFT artists can easily create/ mint generic NFTs register them as open for derivative works and charge for each time their works are used for further creations. By doing so they can expand the scope and reach of their creations while still retaining control over their intellectual property.In addition our platform enables the accumulation of NFT attributes such as a character's strength or abilities in RPG games or the fusion of multiple limited editions of NFTs. This feature is not yet standardized in the NFT world and we are excited to provide a streamlined solution for NFT projects looking for collaborations.To demonstrate the fusion potential we use an AI art generator StableDiffusion for users to open blind boxes with multiple NFTs as sources.We envision a future where the possibilities of derivative works of NFTs are endless from levelling up users' roles in NFT games to creating fan art and social profiles that fuse different NFTs. With PolyNFT we are committed to providing a platform that enables every creative possibility in the world of NFTs. Join us on this exciting journey today!We envision a broad future of derivative works of NFTs whether it be NFT games levelling up users' roles NFT hodlers creating fan art fusing various NFT social profiles or any funkier usage we haven't known yet. With PolyNFT we are committed to providing a platform that enables every creative possibility in the world of NFTs. For the blind box feature we've surveyed and tried out many AI art generator projects and finally decided to adopt StableDiffusion to generate fused NFTs.For creators to register or mint generic NFTs on our platform we not only register their NFTs in our smart contract but also upload the NFTs to IPFS.In terms of blockchain infrastructure we have selected Ethereum and Polygon due to their mature ecosystems and NFT prosperity. Currently we have deployed our project on Matic for demonstration purposes.See our slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wDtDPMCRMSUdQwMXy2wxnOQyP4YJFU179wRtuNIoOyQ/edit?usp=sharing",

By creating a sustainable AI-generated content market Mimiku encourages innovation.Mimiku is a blockchain-powered platform that incentivizes fair compensation for original creators and AI prompt engineers in the AI-generated content market.As AI technology continues to advance there's a huge demand for high-quality training data. And this led to uncontrolled misuse content of celebrities and creators without permission and the IP providers are not getting any incentives on it. This is a big problem and the fact that there aren't any laws protecting creators just makes it worse.Mimiku seeks to address this problem by providing a royalty-based model hub for original and secondary creators. The platform allows IP providers to upload their data which AI prompt engineers can then use to generate content. The royalty generated by the secondary content will be distributed to both the original and secondary creators in a fair and transparent manner.By leveraging World ID Mimiku provides the digital identity to the IP provider while fully protecting their privacy. Mimiku enables easy login access with Metamask using Metamask SDK. With Lens protocol all transactions and royalty payments are distributed and recorded immutably on Polygon.This incentivizes both original and secondary creators to contribute to the platform driving the growth of a more sustainable and ethical AI-generated content market. There are four parts to our project.Lens protocolWe have used lens protocol extensively to create an hierarchy of AI model trainer (creators) and prompt engineer. In lens terms AI model holder creates a publication with an endpoint url that invokes the stable diffusion model to generate the image. The prompt engineer may generate an image with a prompt using the endpoint url of the publication and create a comment referencing the original model publication. In addition to the generated image the endpoint url also generates a zero knowledge proof which proves that image was indeed generated by the model that was published.In order to verify the proof that the image was actually generated using published model we have written an imaginary Lens Reference module ModelCheckpointReferenceModule which verifies the referencing comment or mirror.Our custom modulehttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/contracts/core/contracts/core/modules/reference/ModelCheckpointReferenceModule.solUsage of Lens-react to build UI componentsLogin & Model publicationhttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/my-app/src/app/components/directory/directory.component.jsxGenerating image and creating commentshttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/my-app/src/app/components/PostForm/index.tsxPolygonWe have used Lens protocol and Worldcoin to deploy our contract to the Polygon testatehttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/contracts/core/contracts/core/modules/reference/ModelCheckpointReferenceModule.solWorldCoinOur Lens Module uses WorldCoin SDK to verify the model publisher is an authentic human to prevent non-human publishing stable diffusion modelhttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/contracts/core/contracts/core/modules/reference/ModelCheckpointReferenceModule.solMetaMaskOur dApp uses metamask SDK to login to Polygon Mumbai testnethttps://github.com/jinmel/ethtokyo2023/blob/main/my-app/src/app/components/directory/directory.component.jsx",

    description:
      "We have developed a decentralized escrow protocol that enables trustless off-chain deals for buying and selling real goods crowdsourcing and p2p crypto fiat trades.We have a game theory background.<Problem>We know that the ability to exchange on-chain values such as NFTs and crypto trustlessly through mechanisms such as DEX and NFT marketplace is a revolution.However in off-chain deals there is a problem called the trade dilemma: send the goods first or pay first.Censorship and high fees by platformers such as visa and ebay are also problems.A decentralized escrow protocol based on game theory solve this problems.<Rule of DeDeal> Basic Deal Flow:1.The seller sends 1 ETH to the protocol as a deposit and the protocol adds 1 ETH to the seller deposit.2.The buyer sends 1 ETH to the protocol as payment for the goods and the protocol adds 1 ETH to the seller deposit.3.The seller ships the goods to the buyer.4.If the buyer does not sanction (i.e. press the sanction button) by the deadline the deal is closed and the protocol sends 2 ETH in the seller deposit to the seller.If the Seller Commits Fraud:If in step 3 above the seller does not send the goods to the buyer the buyer has the following two options:[Option 1-1] Suck It UpJust suck it up. If the sanction button is not pressed before the deadline the protocol will send 2 ETH in the seller deposit to the seller.As a result the seller gets 1 ETH and the buyer loses 1 ETH.[Option 1-2] Sanction the SellerBy pressing the sanction button the 2 ETH in the seller deposit is burned. However in order for the buyer to press the sanction button the buyer must first send 2 more ETH to the protocol as a buyer deposit. Each time the sanction button is pressed the deadline will be extended by the deadline interval set before the deal was initiated.If the buyer chooses <Option 1-2> the seller now has the following two options:[Option 2-1] Accept the SanctionIf the sanction button is not pressed back by the seller before the deadline the protocol will send 2 ETH in the buyer deposit back to the buyer.As a result the seller and the buyer will have lost 1 ETH each.[Option 2-2] Sanction the Buyer BackBy pressing the sanction button the 2 ETH in the buyer deposit is burned. However in order for the seller to press the sanction button the seller must first send 2 more ETH to the protocol as a seller deposit.This option is chosen as a sanction against a sanction when the seller feels that the sanction by the buyer was unjustified.If the seller chooses [Option 2-2] the buyer is once again given the option to choose [Option 1-1] or [Option 1-2].In this way the sanctions continue indefinitely until the seller chooses [Option 1-1] or the buyer chooses [Option 2-1] resulting in both players losing an amount of ETH corresponding to the number of sanctions.<Why DeDeal Works>It is important to note that there is no short-term financial benefit to sanctioning.This is called costly altruistic punishment in economic terms.It is only a risk to impose sanctions when no fraud has been committed because sanctions can be imposed against sanctions.One-way fraud is a lose-win but the fear of a lose-lose situation due to sanctions makes people choose win-win deals.In the real world catching the criminals does not directly benefit the victim but the fear of the punishment reduces crimes. The ultimatum game in economic experiments the Code of Hammurabi and the hostage exchange of warring feudal lords are examples of win-win relationships established through costly punishment.In situations where one can punch the other one respects the other. We introduce punching into anonymous societies without police and form order.In the real world centralized power such as the police force sanction on behalf of the victim.Thomas Hobbes called them Leviathan. But there is no Leviathan in the crypto world.That is why we need self-sovereign sanctions as in the Middle Ages.<UseCase>DeDeal is for cross-border transactions where there is no common and reliable C2C service or in countries where there is no reliable central authority.<FAQ>Q1. Can the buyer threaten to burn the deposit and extort money?Just say ‚ÄùYou burn I burn.‚Äù Do not give in to threats and send money as there is no assurance that they will release the deposit. If they think you are a chicken who can't choose low-lose you would be a loser in lose-win.Q2. Sanctioned badly by the rich?Sanctions are never more than you can tolerate because sanctions end when one of you accepts them. It is also difficult even in the real world of law to stop a madman from harming others without fear of punishment.Q3. Does DeDeal Really Work?It depends on the nature of the agents: since DeDeal is a meta-game if the players always punish fraud fraud is less likely to occur; if many people don't sanction to fraud fraud is more likely to occur. However experiments such as the Prisoner's Dilemma have shown the advantage of the tit for tat strategy and when some players begin to adopt the tit for tat strategy the environment as a whole tends to do so as well. In other words user education UX and deposit ratio adjustments can lead to a fraud-free environment. Our project DeDeals is a decentralized escrow service built on Ethereum that handles secure transactions between buyers and sellers. It uses Solidity for smart contract creation and is deployed using zkEVM.By using zkEVM our project benefits from enhanced privacy and reduced gas costs. The increased privacy afforded by zkEVM is especially important because DeDeal is a protocol for conducting transactions without the need for a third party.",

We adopt a community-driven approach based on the Web3 philosophy and use CC0 standards to enable interoperability between different games by utilizing NFTs driven by users.What you do with this service is think of the character name you think is the strongest and fight with an NFT-ized character. I will provide a detailed explanation of how this project was built. First the technologies used are as follows:The contract was deployed on "Linea".The login function was realized using the MetaMask SDK. This allows for easy user authentication on the website and integration with the wallet.We made it possible to automatically generate detailed monster information by simply inputting their characteristics. This automatic generation is achieved using GPT-3.5. As a result anyone can automatically create diverse and original monsters.Monster details can be minted as NFTs (ERC721). This allows users to truly own the automatically generated monsters making them their own in a true sense.NFTs are implemented fully on-chain and we do not use distributed storage such as IPFS. This ensures the complete integrity and transparency of the data.For the PvP function we made it possible to battle with a randomly selected monster from the minted NFTs.Victory or defeat results are automatically generated using GPT-3.5. This has resolved the issue of PvP becoming unfeasible due to a lack of players.As a particularly hacky point worth mentioning using GPT-3.5 to generate monster details and victory/defeat results has made it possible to create an innovative and exciting gaming experience. Additionally the full on-chain implementation of NFTs ensures data integrity and transparency. By combining these technologies this project provides users with a unique entertainment experience.',

While open-source projects are critical for the growth and sustainability of the industry adopting code contributions from multiple developers can be time-consuming and challenging for project owners and maintainers. Additionally it can be challenging for developers to follow coding standards and maintain code quality.To address these challenges our team developed a novel solution that leverages token rewards managed by CommitRewarder to incentivize and reward high-quality code contributions. Our solution integrates with Github Action and ChatGPT as the backbone to support our token reward system. Developers who submit code that meets our project's coding standards can earn tokens and NFT badges promoting sustainability in the crypto world.Our solution offers several benefits for open-source projects. First it incentivizes developers to submit high-quality code that meets coding standards helping to maintain code quality and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. Second it streamlines the code adoption process by allowing project owners and maintainers to focus on reviewing high-quality code submissions saving time and resources. Finally it promotes community engagement and collaboration by encouraging developers to contribute to open-source projects and earn rewards for their efforts.To implement our solution we developed a Github Action that integrates with CommitRewarder to manage token rewards and NFT badges. Our solution uses ChatGPT as the backbone to provide code suggestions and feedback to developers helping them to improve their code quality and meet our project's coding standards. The ChatGPT model provides a reliable and accurate method for evaluating code submissions ensuring that we can maintain code quality while scaling our solution to multiple projects.Overall our project aims to improve the sustainability and code quality of open-source projects in the crypto world.

    description:
      "Tokyo Hackathon: ZKP_FIGHT_AI:The aim of this project is to help users distinguish between genuine human-created digital content and AI-generated fakes. We will achieve this by leveraging a new ZKECDSA scheme called Spartan-ecdsa.This approach allows devices with private keys to sign within a group of public keys without revealing sensitive information. For the ETHGlobal Tokyo hackathon we will use the 'control of ETH address' method for a better user experience despite its slower response time. Users can show that they are apart of a group while maintaining the privacy of their address. Outside the scope of fighting AI this tech can be used for NFT trading or other transactions where exposing a public address is undesirable.For example we could sign from an address to show that we possess a specific NFT without revealing our underlying public address. Or we could demonstrate that we have access to an account with over $10000 USD in value without exposing the trading history or account balance associated with that address.Both BTC and ETH utilize ECDSA signatures which offers numerous benefits in terms of usage and tooling.Motivation:AI has the ability to process content from audio sources and convincingly replicate human voices. This can lead to impersonation misinformation or worse across a variety of media formats. Our challenge is to establish the authenticity of content and determine whether it is AI-generated or not. Find more motivation in this Twitter thread.How it works:Spartan-ecdsa is the fastest open-source method to verify secp256k1 ECDSA signatures in zero-knowledge.Users can visit ZKPfightAI and post a link to their media. They can sign using either a private key or their ETH address via MetaMask or another tool. A proof is generated which can be verified by anyone using their browser. Content owners can provide a \"human-authenticated ZKBadge\" and URL. Users can then confirm that the content they are viewing has been verified.Hardware devices such as cameras and phones could have private keys uploaded to them. Since we do not want to expose any single key in the group of device keys we would use this ZKECDSA method. There is an interesting video on ZKP for misinformation prevention on YouTube.Blockchain:Hosting proofs and verifying them on-chain is a trustless way for anyone to confirm the source of information. As artificial intelligence becomes more advanced blockchain with ZKP will play a significant role in preventing deep-fakes and misinformation. ZKP that run fast on user and resource-constrained devices will play a prominent role in protecting against fakes. I used Next.js for the app server with React and Tailwind.css for the user interface. Ethereum accounts with Metamask is one signing method. I left an option open for users who have private key access to sign with ZKECDSA directly; this is important for hardware devices. Circom is used for the internal workings of the zero-knowledge proofs circuits with Snarkjs.One core module that is used is @personaelabs/spartan-ecdsa. This module uses a zero-knowledge proof system called Spartan. It is modified to increase performance on user and resource constrained device. Signing with private keys is still quicker than signing with an ETH address. The reason for this is hashing is a slow operation in ZK systems. Public address need to be put through a Keccak hash to be converted to an Ethereum address.This work is the first public repo demonstrating this tech in a user app. Since it is open source anyone can now get up and running with their own use-case. Investigations have been done over the course of the hackathon to speed up the Kekkak hash proof and wrap the proof into another proof (recursion); to make the final proof smaller and explored recursion/folding. We can do this with a schemes like Polygon's Plonky2 Groth16 Nova or any other scheme that outputs small proofs..  Some of this work is slightly out of the scope of the limited time-constraints here. I was able to make something that works 100% and is really fast!",

Additionally reducing the currently high fees associated with CtoC trading in Japan is a priority as this will make the market more accessible and competitive for all participants. Following are our project base.Safe Protocol Kit Used to create multi-signature contract wallets. Guarantees the payment of rewards by depositing them from the requester at the beginning of the transaction.Push Protocol A push notification and chat service based on wallet addresses. Push notifications are used when there are changes in the work process. Chat is used for daily communication between clients and workers.Huddle01 An online meeting service similar to Zoom. Used to facilitate smoother communication compared to text-only communication. Although wallet authentication can be used for token authentication we do not use token authentication in this case as it is only available on the mainnet.ThirdWeb Used for NFT contract generation and wallet authentication.Database Used to manage information that needs to be changed.",

      'A framework of access control in a dApp that utilizes signatures created by Lit Protocol. This allows for real-time access control to dApps meaning that if a user has a designated role on a Discord channel lit protocol will check the role in real-time and grant them permission to execute the dApp. Today we will be presenting the results of our hackathon. This time we came up with a use case for Lit\'s "Proof". Specifically we can use Lit as a Verifier for ZK and as an Access Control Manager for dApp. Recently ZK has been used in Identity-related fields but there are still many issues to be solved in on-chain verification.Therefore I have developed "ZK Airdropper" as a sample program. This program proposes a mechanism to perform an Airdrop for Japanese ETHTokyo participants.The procedure is as followsRegister your credentials in a smart contract.Match the qualification identifier to the CID of the IPFS in the Lit Actions.Make the contract executable when multiple qualifications are met.In this case only the minimum necessary information will be disclosed to ensure privacy.Qualification can be obtained based on data on VC or web services. For example assume that the government issues a W3C compliant VC as proof of Japanese nationality and that Holder has a YouTube video promoting ETHTokyo with over 10000 views.To verify these within Lit Actions we use a ZKP-compliant BBS BLS signature for the VC and execute the Node.js code from within Lit using a library provided by MATTR. In this case we ran Node.js within Lambda and called it from Lit Actions but we believe that Lit\'s ability to import external packages will make it possible to run Lit Actions alone.Next we will verify the YouTube video using the YouTube Data API to get the number of views and the contributor can be verified by posting the wallet\'s signature in the description field. and implemented IP restrictions on the nodes in the Lit Actions. In this way real-time information from non-VC web services can also be used to qualify for airdrops.Future work could involve users generating one-time access tokens via OAuth and passing them to the Lit Node. Such a mechanism would improve security and privacy.In summary we proposed a use case for Lit\'s "Proof" feature in this hackathon and developed a sample program called ZK Airdropper.',

    description:
      "Case Study: In recent years Japanese milk farmers have faced numerous challenges such as volatile milk prices increasing production costs due to the war and covid crisis and the pressure from the government to increase the supply that happned pre-covid. As a result since schools were closed and milks were not consumed many small to medium-sized dairy farmers are struggling to maintain their operations and support their families. 1/3 of milk farmers in Hokkaido has shut down their businesses. The ones that are alive the situation is still doomed---the government decided to offer $1000 (15 man yen) for farmers to kill their milk cows in order to decrease the supply. Tons of milks are being disposed yet government also has their own business which is diplomatic import business. They do not want to fully depend on domestic milk supply. Government consumers everyone has a bit of responsibility but no one is here to save farmers and cows.The Web3 Crowdfunding Solution:Web3 crowdfunding offers a promising alternative to help milk farmers overcome their financial challenges. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms crowdfunding campaigns can be created to raise funds for these struggling farmers as well as launching new project such as exporting and find all the necessary stakeholders in order to execute.Some benefits of using Web3 crowdfunding for milk farmers include:Direct support: Donors can contribute directly to the farmers they want to support eliminating intermediaries and ensuring that the funds reach the intended recipients.Global reach: Web3 crowdfunding campaigns can attract donors from around the world providing a larger pool of potential supporters and increasing the chances of a successful campaign.Transparency and trust: Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent secure and easily traceable allowing donors to see exactly how their contributions are being used.Speed and efficiency: Funds raised through Web3 crowdfunding campaigns can be transferred quickly and securely allowing farmers to access the financial support they need without waiting for government assistance. Right now at this moment milk farmers are quitting their jobs. On Twitter you can meet farmers selling all their cows and exiting their business every month every week. The problem cannot go through beurocratic structure it needs an immediate help.Token rewards: As an added incentive farmers can offer unique tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to donors as a form of reward further encouraging support for their cause. This is an advantage of our everything-marketplace that they can consult choose solutions fundraise recruit generate NFTs and sell.We have made stimulative frontend with smart contract that can be associated with NFTs and will enhance more sales for the users who are going to use our platform. Namely we built functions and pages:-Crowdfunding project Mockup-Marketplace : NFTs and Jobs-Case study story-Wallet-Create Project Page-NFT product pageIn conclusion Web3 crowdfunding offers a modern and efficient solution to help milk farmers navigate the challenges they face. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and decentralized finance platforms we do what the government cannot/will not do. This is the philosophy of web3 and NexaCrowd represents it. This project is built using React(Nextjs) and Tailwind. Metamask API was called and activated upon click. chatGPT API is being stored and ready to be unlocked (it is now simulated as hardcode)For generating QR codes the project uses the 'qrcode.react' package which will allow user to purchase product from associated convinience store and get NFT sticker (samples were created and printed out).We stored NFTs on IPFS data on thegraph and using polygon.",

    description:
      "Overall:By utilizing the TCR method for product and service information we aim to create an unprecedented database that is decentralized independent from companies  information highly transparent and systematically eliminates arbitrariness and ensures legitimacy.Problem:The problem it solves is that consumers do not know what is truly sustainable when they purchase goods and services.Solution and Technologies:By providing a personal sustainability management application on which the database is decentralized and transparent by using token curated registries. Any users can check on how sustainability is measured.What's next forBy creating this database and providing consumers with information on their consumption through their household accounts we aim to provide consumers with a social value standard other than the monetary value standard of products and services. Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details.Our project aims to solve the problem that consumers do not know which product is sustainable. To solve that problem we wanted to elaborate a decentralized sustainable data and metrics system that is to be linked to consumer housekeeping applications. We unfortunately did not have the time to create the metrics which require expertise skills but a basic idea of how the database will be accumulated..We adopted the token curated registries (TCR) approach to make the sustainability database decentralized transparent and neutral as possible. The registries work as below steps:User A enters information about a product X while depositing some token on itAnother User B enters a different information about product X also depositing money that is in part conflicted with User A.An User can only vote consecutively to his/her idea by paying a deposit that increase exponentiallySo that is why it is better to convince and put on your side other people in order to push your information to be adopted by the databaseThe deposit will be returned to the winner based on the contribution to the database stored in a decentralized manner.We again did not have the time to discuss concrete token economics to effectively incentivize consumers but the revenue model from which the money flow is clear.Based on the Customer Data Platform business model we will aggregate real-life consumption and preferences of consumers to be provided to companies. The data will help them to have a better marketing and persona of their users and add value to their product especially in a time where sustainability is as important as never before.Again it is important that users are sovereign of their data and they can choose either to get money by providing data or not.What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together?Since our project is related to ReFi we have used only Celo‚Äôs technologies to implement our idea. As its website mentions: ‚ÄúCelo is the carbon-negative mobile-first EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem leading a thriving new digital economy for all.‚Äù Our idea contributes to the ReFi domain from a consumer perspective and therefore having a carbon-negative chain is utmost important in terms of accountability towards our idea. Moreover our product is an application that is conceived to be on mobile-phone fitting exactly with the principle of Celo‚Äôs mobile-first. Lastly throughout consumption we aim to create a new digital economy and bring a new form of capitalism that is sustainable responsible and accountable from far-located refugee children to people representing our far future on whom we are going to leave our Earth.If you used any sponsor technologies how did it benefit your project?Celo is the most refi-centric blockchain present in this ETHGlobal Tokyo hackathon. By using Celo we make a clear interpretation of our project to align with ReFi values as so far proposed such as Toucan Kolektivo etc‚Ä¶ Furthermore we are seeking Celo‚Äôs incubation hackathon and support eco-system that could fit with our product to make it scale. As already mentioned in the technologies used this time Celo was the protocol that fit the most to our TCR idea in terms of scalability and light mobile application link.Did you do anything particularly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning?We have tried to create a system where involved consumers do not necessarily need to have an understanding of Web3 and related concepts. The minimal action required by the user is to create a wallet and to connect it with the offered APIs. By doing so the user can have access to on-chain data where real-time sustainability assessment is updated through the TCR. We believe it could help to ease the entry cost of non-crypto native peoples and could contribute to the mass adoption of blockchain technologies or at least its first step: creating a wallet.",

    description:
      "We created a NFT Utility Deligation Protocol which allows BAYC NFT owners to delegate certain utilities to others that they would not use themselves. This is done by making it easy for anyone to add utilities to BAYC but allowing only the current BAYC owners to manage its utilities on-chain individually using the new EIP that we also wrote on this ETH-Tokyo hackathon. Whole process is completely decentralized and permissionless.Also we have integrated the Lens protocol considering the needs of stakeholders interested in expanding the NFT community and those who wish to engage with NFTs.< How this benefits Participants >@. BAYC Owner- Able to generate profit by delegating specific utilities to others that they‚Äôll never use themselves.- Original BAYC NFT itself remains completely untouched even if delegate utilities thanks to new EIP.@. Utility User- Able to experience the specific utility of BAYC without buying one.@. Utility Creator (Event Host)- Able to invite BAYC holders to their events / platforms very easily.@. BAYC Community- The higher the community value the higher the barrier. But if you make it more accessible by ‚ÄòinviteAPE‚Äô more people will experience the benefits temporarily and it will immediately benefit the BAYC community. It's like a high-end car becomes much more desirable by offering a test drive. inviteAPE App  <-- Click to experience demo There are three parts to our project.First we sought a simple method for enhancing the utility of NFTs. We discovered a way to increase their utility without transferring the original NFT. With this in mind we researched the process of writing an EIP aiming to develop a successful one. Although there is still much work to be done we have completed the First Draft: https://hackmd.io/@HxaSeEhDRX2AOjXinPg2dw/rJ6Yr_ufn During this process we realized that even if we increase the number of NFT utility a single user will never be able to extract and utilize all the utilities of NFTs so we created the NFT Utility Delegation Protocol to solve this problem and allow multiple users to delegate the utilities of a single NFT. To do thisWe heavily referenced the Seaport Solidity code. Through this code we learned a lot about various signature algorithms and efficient smart contract operations.Analyzed the solidity code of NFT rental marketplaces including reNFT.This gave us a clue as to how the utility can be transferred to another party without the original NFT itself being transferred to another party. Based on these two studies we were able to write the smart contract code for a sustainable and functioning NFT Utility Delegation Protocol.Lastly we experimented with a new library called Wagmi which offers a range of convenient hooks to simplify interactions with the blockchain. We can build on this to make interacting with contracts more convenient.",

    description:
      "We've used hacking-scripts to scrape specific collection data of most popular NFT collections to create pricing templates for different traits of NFT tokens.Then by utilizing merkle-trees approach we are storing this data inside oracle smart-contract with ability to verify the input based on tokenId and collectionAddress for specific NFTs.By using ChainLink oracle price feed for collections as a base to get the floor price (https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) we apply specific percentage for the NFT token trait to keep the pricing value relative to the floor price data and cap it with maximum possible pricing.This allows us to create custom PawnShop contract with Solidity to call more powerful Traits Oracle and apply a price for different NFT tokens based on their rarity and traits for each token that can be verified on-chain!As a Demo we've created a contract that allows to borrow funds with NFTs based on the rarity of some traits that shop owner sets relative to floor price. User can repay the loan later on retrieving their NFTs. We are scraping initial collection data from Alchemy API and storing this all in data folder. This allows us to have data on all tokens and their traits.Then we parse this data to create unique pricing template for each NFT collection allowing the pricing oracle master (or NFTPawn shop owner) to price specific traits.After traits are price via providing relative percent (%) to the collection floor price and maximum value shop would accept we generate merkle-tree and store merkle-root in the Oracle contract. This then is applied on top of floor-price that is guaranteed by ChainLink floor price oracle. This way our traits oracle to price NFT tokens relative to the floor price based on each tokens individual trait (if it was priced)As a result we've used create-react-dapp to produce short demo for allowing users take loans using their NFTs as collateral and utilize ability to price some NFTs higher than the floor price (or below) depending on preference of the shop owner.The pricing template before merkle-tree gets generates is also uploaded to IPFS for reference of input data and onChain verification",

For this project we created an iOS app using Swift to provide a better ownership experience.The technology utilized this time was MetaMaskSDK to obtain the user's Wallet information and based on the WalletAddress Airstack's TokenBalancesAPI was used to obtain the NFT and related information held by the WalletAPI.You can list the NFTs you own here.We chose Airstack because it offers a larger number of schemers than conventional ones and because it is GraphQL which allows us to retrieve complex data.One particularly difficult point was the connection between Swift and GraphQL.By clearing this area we were able to smoothly express Graph information in swift.However GraphQL and Swift were not very compatible and there were still some issues such as the inability to reflect the type of NFT attributes.",

After the first Wave Wave 2 begins which runs automatically until it is stopped.Once the Wave Hackathon is turned on it runs automatically and is a sucker for developers. We used the UMA protocol from Safe's zodiac to implement this protocol.We also use Snapshot to evaluate submissions to hackathons. We utilize UMA as the oracle for converting the voting information to this Snapshot into an on-chain Transaction.We implemented a custom extension because it was not possible to inject voting results into the contract with the existing Snapshot. We added a button that allows injection of voting results if there is a uint[] argument in the transaction submitted to UMA.The snapshot repository (branch: feature/inject_votes) can be found at:https://github.com/akindo-io/snapshotTest environment:http://54.250.78.147/#/Example proposalhttp://54.250.78.147/#/akindotest.eth/proposal/0x6548cf07e3c8afc7af5b9c15149e7ec00955061f7e99b818e31060d7a9fc05a4Transactions approved through UMA will be distributed to hackers according to the percentage of prior votes.

      "Qi is a transaction auction platform that reduces transaction cost for transactions. The cost reduction comes from three places 1. MEV redistribution 2. transaction exeuction 3. and gas fees",
    description:
      "Users constantly overpay for block space these days. The expensive amount comes in three different formsMEVpoor transaction executiongas feesThe solution space currently is fragmented with well-designed protocols yet they don't address the issue holistically. Qi provides a solution that address all of above.Qi is a transaction auction platform that allows users to auction off the right to execute their transactions to solvers third-party specialized agents that compete for providing the lowest cost of block space for users. Solvers are sophisticated network participants who could be MEV searchers or Cow Protocol-like solvers who solve optimization problems to increase users' utility functions.Through the auction Qi is providing a transaction cost maximization and value leakage minimization solution that achieve these design goals:permissionless access - this applies to solvers and users;programmable privacy - users can selectively shield their transactionstrust minimization - an auctioneer is a smart contract so no risk of manipulationmeritocracy based - the auction is purely based on who's capable to provide the best utility to each individual userThis is how it works:-users sign off messages that represent their transactional intent using the erc1271 compatible signature scheme. User can selectively shield their message to prevent solvers from stealing MEV. However this could also increase the difficulty for solvers to include the transaction. So there's a element of game theoretic dynamic between user and solver here;-messages are stored at an off-chain server that has a WebSocket opened to solvers;-solvers will monitor database updates continuously to look for new messages being added;-the auction will run by epochs and each epoch lasts 24 seconds(2 blocks);-at the beginning of each epoch Qi takes a snapshot of all the existing messages in the server and will only include those messages in the current auction. New messages will be included in a queue for the next auction-during the auction solvers will bid for batched of transactions. If two batches contain completely different transactions then they won't compete with one another. However if two batches include conflicting transactions the auction selection algorithm will determine who has the right to include conflicting transactions.The auction selection algorithm is a utility function that takes all three factors(MEV rebate price execution and gas fee subsidization) into consideration given a solver's bid. A solver will not win the right of execution simply because he/she provides a better price for each individual user in the batch. If the execution price is negatively impacted by solver's ordering or arbitrage transaction to a point where the slippage is worst than the bid a solver might not win the auction against a lower bid batch but provides better transaction execution;-since some user messages might be private we'll provide a simulation API to return the simulated outcome of a batch. Then they'll change the batch logic a little bit and submit it for simulation again. In this sense solvers are constantly performing \"proof of work\" to try to find the best combination and order of transaction possible.-The solvers will be able to see each other batches' simulated outcomes and transactions included in the batch but the bids will be sealed until the auction is complete. This will create an incomplete information game among solvers.-The auction is eventually settled on-chain through a dedicated smart contract. So no centralized auctioneer could manipulate the auction outcome;-messages that are not included by any of the batches will go into the next auction. The user will set an expiry time for the message and what to do when it expires. When a message expires will route it through 1inch Fusion to provide the best possible transaction outcome. Qi uses the ERC1271 signature scheme to collect user messages. Then put it into a Postgres database. A WebSocket connection is established to feed the data stream to a group of solvers. Solver will submit a bid through the Auction.sol smart contract. The bid is determined based on a utility function. Not collected bid will be sent to 1inch.1inch Fusion provides the best order execution solution in the game. When a user message is not signed it will be routed to 1inch Fusion directly for executionQi will also have a vertical integration with MetaMask and 4337 wallets. The integration with MetaMask is done through Snap. And because Qi uses 1271 signature scheme it's compatible with all 4337 wallets. Later we will implement a customized Paymaster contract for users to auction off their transactions and receive bids for their transactions directly.Superfluid supports a nice feature to stream payout to a designated address. Qi supports this feature to prevent the solver from griefing the auction payoff process.",

Users contribute to AI training earn rewards and shape policies securing data privacy ownership and fair rewards in a sustainable AI ecosystem.FUGA the Federated User-Generated Avatar (AI) is a groundbreaking solution powered by Blockchain and Federated Learning that is set to redefine the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). By leveraging the vast amounts of data generated by everyday users AI has grown increasingly intelligent. Nonetheless these contributors often lack control over the AI models' policies and receive no recognition for their invaluable data contributions. FUGA addresses this disparity by incorporating Federated Learning and Blockchain technologies fostering a sustainable AI training ecosystem that enables individuals to participate directly in the AI model training process obtain rewards for their data contributions and even influence the model's policies.Federated Learning is a decentralized approach to AI model training that allows multiple clients to collaborate on model development while preserving data privacy. By keeping data on local devices Federated Learning enables models to learn from shared insights without exposing the raw data thereby enhancing privacy and security.At its core FUGA aims to create AI chatbots that capture and represent the unique attributes of specific communities. Through efficient filtering and processing of vast data robust privacy protection and assurance of rightful ownership and fair compensation FUGA lays the foundation for a more equitable and thriving Decentralized AI-driven future. We utilized a decentralized federated learning structure for AI training. Clients (nodes) exchange trained models with each other aggregate and evaluate them. By repeating this process overall performance improvement is achieved and models optimized for individual data are produced. We also deployed a contract on the Polygon testnet which allows a smart contract to act as the controller without the need for a centralized aggregator. Furthermore trained models are converted into NFTs and rewarded based on the degree of contribution through the smart contract. Consequently data providers can maintain their data privacy while receiving rightful ownership and fair compensation for their data.",

    description:
      ' images and graphs so you can obtain any data you need for your Web3 journey.For many Web3 users we are certain that many people have heard the phrase "the data is on the blockchain so everybody can see it." But how many have actually tried to do it and then realized how difficult it is to query the data on the blockchain when it is more than just 1 transaction? We have created the solution for that problem: We make querying data on the blockchain (for now Ethereum and Polygon mainnets) easy using AI-powered natural language understanding and a friendly user interface for Web3 technology.Members of our teams have various potential use cases for this web app:Obtain NFT images owned by a certain entity. This could be aIn terms of number of follower get the Lens handles for the top 5 most popular ids.Obtain the aggregate statistics on certain NFT collections on popular marketplaces (for now Opensea and Rarible)Obtain data for recent transactions within the past 7 days for a certain walletFor an Ethereum Name Service name (for example "dwr.eth") we can get the Farcaster name Farcaster account details connected address and all token balances and imagesAs of project submission deadline please keep in mind that we cannot address all of the above-mentioned use cases due to time limitation. With our best effort we have been able to make querying the blockchain both an easy-to-understand and enjoyable experience through some simple use cases. User can also send the query\'s result to any recipient with a Polygon address through simple push messaging.Basically the more protocols and data that we plug in the more possibilities will open up for us to query.We also think that this simple yet user-friendly web app would help to onboard the next million new people into web3 while empowering data geeks with the information they need for their web3 journey.*Side notes and trivia: for those that may be wondering where the name Octoplorer came from it is a combination of the words "octopus" and "explorer". I (Lam) chose octopus as the representative animal because:üêô Octopus is fast it can swim up to 25 miles per hour. That is faster than Michael Phelps!An octopus can multitask well due to its large nerve cluster. It has something like a "minibrain" at the base of each arm to independently control its movement. That\'s why it can grab multiple blockchain transactions simultaneously! For the ideation stage Lam literally drew the wireframe of the website on paper. Then Andrey used Figma to draft up a mock layout of the website along with the Octoplorer logo. For the blockchain data we are thankful for the support of the sponsors Airstack and Lens Protocol. Thanks to Airstack\'s powerful up-to-the-minute API we could query blockchain data on both Ethereum and Polygon mainnet. For Lens Protocol (on Polygon) we can also query many Lens-related identities such as handles id number of followers. For the natural-language query we use OpenAI\'s ChatGPT 3.5 "text-davinci-003" model enhanced by the langchain (open-source) library to empower the AI even further. When a user writes a query on the front-end we have an large-language-model (LLM) agent that would decide whether that is a Len-related query or an Airstack-related query. After the LLM agent decides the model then the query would be routed to the right ChatGPT model to interpret the query and write the appropriate GraphQL code. From there the GraphQL code would then be passed to the right API endpoint (Airstack or Lens) to obtain the data necessary. After the data is obtained we will then display the results back to the user in an easy-to-understand format including tables images and/or graphs. For the front-end we used Next.js Tailwind and React. We have also integrated web3 wallet sign-in (including Metamask) using "wagmi" and rainbow kit libraries. Thanks to the sponsor Push we have also enabled a messaging service that allows users to send the results of their queries to any recipient on Ethereum mainnet without leaving the application. Since any LLM is non-deterministic by the nature of the model and GraphQL code for a specific protocol is strictly conformant to that protocol\'s unique schema we did some hacky and creative things in order for some of the queries to work consistently. Please feel free to ask us about this if you are curious. :)',

      ' and you can have a way of indicating how much trust you have without revealing your score to others. "Consensus Score" allows individuals to hold a score that represents how much others trust them which can help establish a new trust system. This score is kept using zero-knowledge proofs meaning that the score itself cannot be revealed to anyone other than the score holder. Validators can input an account address to verify how highly someone is rated but the actual score is not displayed. Instead Consensus Score displays how many stars someone has based on their level of trust according to others achieved through the use of zero-knowledge proofs. Our project utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable score holders to prove they are trustworthy while maintaining privacy and validators can use the blockchain to know that the score cannot be tampered with allowing them to determine whether someone is trustworthy or not based on their score. In our project we mainly use Homomorphic Encryption and zkSNARK. In the Consensus Score when sender A inputs a score M it is encrypted with the public key of receiver B. The encrypted score E(m pkB) is then processed with Homomorphic Encryption. The encrypted score is added to the original score E(n pkB). E(m pkB) + E(n pkB) = E(x pk) is the result of this calculation. Once the calculation is completed we check whether the sender is registered in the whitelist. If they are registered we record the calculation result on the blockchain. When the score owner visits their MyPage or a verifier verifies the score proof generation and verification begin on Circom. Encrypted total score and encrypted number of evaluators are input to public input on Circom. Average score calculation is performed on Circom and the output is the average score and the rate. Circom proves the correctness of the input by inputting the total score still encrypted and also proves the correctness of the average score calculation and the execution.',

      'Our project takes the fun and excitement of Pokemon and infuses it with the power of NFT assets to create a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. But we didn\'t stop there. We wanted to ensure that the game was fair and equal for all players so we developed a unique approach using cryptography combined with Commitment and Reveal Scheme.To make the experience even more unique we analyzed each player\'s personal Web3 NFT collection and generated a set of "Poke3mons" tailored specifically to them. This means that every player will have a completely unique set of creatures to operate and use in battle that comes with own attributes emulating the success seen in the original game.Furthermore we didn\'t let the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain hold us back. We undestood that onchain games were immensely expensive. So we utilized cross chain message relayers to bridge the game onto a separate chain allowing us to take advantage of the growing potential of Layers 2s and any further developments in the future.So join us on this adventure to catch \'em all and become the ultimate Poke3mon master! For the commitment and reveal scheme we utilized a combination of logic and computational technique to achieve what we wanted. The logic was such the users has to both go through a "commit" and a " reveal" stage in which they both had to commit an encrypted answer into the smart contract during a time period. The order of it did not matter because the information was encrypted so the owner would know but could not be edited.That one once both users committed their decisions we could ask them to reveal their answer each (this is needed because it is encrypted) in order to determine the winner.This proved to be successful despite slightly tedious and believe that it can be improved once layer 2 scales and we handle the transactions using account abstraction.As for our other issue of cross chain bridging the original intention was to use a natural bridge or a message relayer such as Layer Zero to pass the information of the NFTs from ETH and Polygon POS to Polygon Zk or other Zk layers.However many of the methods we tried did not seem to be fully functional (including Layer Zero) making it extremely difficult to pursue this. In the end we began by developing a framework that could be easily ported over to a cross chain message relayer when it is ready in order to have a functioning demo.With the remaining time we began looking into using Hyperlane for crosschain messaging so that if we manage to deploy in time we can overcome the issue (or can do it at a later date).',

The dAPP will connect you to a native speaker of the language that you want to practice. Similarly to an uber like system the user will be matched with a native speaker that is currently available and wants to take on your request.How it works:The user sets a budget on how much (per second/block/minute/hour) he / she is willing to pay for talking to a native speaker. All available native speakers will see a call to action whereby they can accept the call. Once a native speaker accepts the call the clock starts to count. The native speaker is paid a rate that the student set initially. Here the novelty is that the student only pays for the amount of time he / she is actually talking to the native speaker. Once the call is ended the clock stops to count and the payment transaction will be completed seamlessly.Benefits for Teachers:Native speakers (teachers) from for example Venezuela have the opportunity to create additional income streams earn currencies that are protected from hyperinflation and have flexible working hours which means they can work whenever they have time.Benefits for Students (Why would anyone want to use DAOlingo?):In short convenience and practicality.

      "This is a music copyright management protocol that utilizes smart contracts. Instead of the complex copyright management systems of the past the efficient and transparent process of smart contracts will allow artists to more easily and proactively manage their rights and revenues for their musical works. It also aims to be flexible enough to adapt to the latest cases of music composition by AI and the use of music in the metaverse space which are expected to become more common in the future. The front was created with react and next.js and the smart contract was deployed with Goerli in Ethreum. Use web3 modal and Wagumi for component headers. On the front unity's webGL recognizes the user's metamask and launches the music player. It also notifies the user when he/she purchases a song using push protocol and allows the user and the owner to communicate with each other via messages.",

But almost all such data is closed in one app and web3 social is still in a early stage so one app could have a few amount of data. So we overcome the dilenma between privacy and good UX. This project used Lit protocol to allow users to control access to the user's private data such as viewing history click sharing on Lens Protocol. Lens and Lit integrations don't support Lit action so it was difficult.Also it used ChatGPT to categoraize the content users viewed for personalization. chatGPT doesn't support Typescript officially but Lens app uses Typescript so it was difficult.",

Experience the transformative power of Jerry Finance and redefine your payroll management today. Smart ContractOn the smart contract side we focused on the user story for the payment recipient. Specifically the recipients will use AA smart contract wallets powered by Safe Wallet so the payroll service has unified integration surface. Because AA makes wallet programmable recipients retain the freedom on what they would like to do whenever payment is received. For example they could hook it up with Monerium to automatically offramp it to a bank account.For this hackathon we implemented an automatic swap function so that user could receive any payment in any cryptocurrency of their choice by piping the payment through UniswapV3. We implemented the Autoswap Module which allows the wallet owner to set desired tokens and source tokens for swapping. The module utilizes execTransactionFromModule function provided by the Safe Wallet to bypass its own security controls and execute token swaps via the Uniswap V3 Router.UsageDeploy the AutoswapModule contract providing the Uniswap V3 Router contract address as a constructor parameter.npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygonEnable the deployed AutoswapModule as a module in the Safe Wallet wallet.e.g. https://app.safe.global/matic:0x04A55848D38EDec988A6F2287B8E00718E14ab14/transactions/tx?id=multisig_0x04A55848D38EDec988A6F2287B8E00718E14ab14_0x5f45465a6e897267c1515b9e9dd0473dfea2b2c1be109ec1f70f4a997af937bcSet a desired token by calling setDesiredToken() from the Safe wallet.Set source tokens that are allowed to be swapped by calling setSourceToken() from the Safe wallet.e.g. https://app.safe.global/matic:0x04A55848D38EDec988A6F2287B8E00718E14ab14/transactions/tx?id=multisig_0x04A55848D38EDec988A6F2287B8E00718E14ab14_0x43fdaa9d4e9c81826a977d877ee73f159e0209f9857ad500bb68f332cfe3c590(Optional) Unset source tokens that should no longer be allowed for swapping by calling unsetSourceToken() from the Safe wallet.Whenever an allowlisted source token is received anyone could swap them into desired token byExecute an autoswap by calling executeAutoswap() providing the Safe address token to swap and the amount to swap.npx hardhat run scripts/autoswap.ts --network polygone.g. https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x2842461e19f4c84203e760b723abe91536ba5f2e8ec9075445cdc0419374c770In the context payroll service the payroll administrator could push this transaction automatically as a contract with their payee. It is also easy to set up relayer / MEV incentives such that an external party will be motivated to facilitate these transactions.In fact it is very much in company's interest to use this set up instead of company actively swapping the tokens before sending to payees. That is because company would have incur taxable event and additional account burden if the settlement currency hits company's book. In this setup the company's payment currency first lands in user's wallet and company is simply facilitating non-custodial blockchain interactions as approved by the user.Contract OverviewSafeWallet Interface: An interface for interacting with the Safe Wallet wallet.AutoswapModule: Main contract implementing the Autoswap Module functionality.setDesiredToken(): Sets the desired token for the Safe wallet.setSourceToken(): Sets a source token to be allowed for swapping.unsetSourceToken(): Unsets a source token disallowing it for swapping.executeAutoswap(): Executes the autoswap for a specified Safe token and amount using the Uniswap V3 Router.FrontendWe have used NuxtJS v3 with Vuetify 3 for the webdevelopment.To implement the registration/login features we have used Safe Auth Kit together with Web3Auth for the login providers.UsageEnter the  jerryfi  folder in the repository.run  yarn install  to install all the dependenciesrun  yarn dev  to run the server in your local machine",

      " an anonymous stablecoin transfer solution and Hyperlane an interchain bridging and messaging protocol. The advent of the Account Abstraction and its first implementation ERC4337 could unlock the full potential of Ethereum by bringing huge UX improvements to Ethereum L1 as it grants ethereum accounts much more flexibility and security. Since we believe that access to a privacy-preserving solution can be highly eased with AA our team decided to build HyperBOB.HyperBOB is an ERC4337-compliant wallet that elegantly implements an anonymous transfer feature on Ethereum L1 where wallet users are able to transfer any stablecoin to another address without exposing the on-chain connection of each address. This is made possible by the combination of cutting-edge technologies such as HyperLane‚Äôs customizable interchain bridge and zkBOB‚Äôs zero-knowledge solution for private token transfer. The zk solution utilized for this private transfer feature is built by zkBOB which is currently only available on Optimism and Polygon but not on Ethereum L1 as its on-chain zk-proof verification is undeniably gas-expensive. However HyperBOB allows users to have access to zkBOB from L1 by integrating Hyperlane‚Äôs Warp API that helps bridge BOB from L1 to Polygon.*The current zkBOB‚Äôs fee model doesn‚Äôt have users pay gas fees on-chain but charges small fees in BOB subtracted from the deposit balance which means that they subsidize the cost of on-chain transactions.Hypelane Warp API consists of two router contracts separately deployed on both local and remote chain. Our HypERC20Collateral on L1 contract serves as a pool for depositing BOB and HyperLane‚Äôs relayer sends a request to HypERC20 that mints a wrapped BOB token to the AA wallet on L2.HypERC20 itself is a token contract that is also compliant with the ERC777 standard and HyperBOB AA wallet implements ERC777receiver interface. Hence when AA wallet contract receives the newly minted BOB tokensReceived method on the AA contract gets triggered in which subsequent functions to deposit BOB to zkBOB contract will be executed.The function used for depositing BOB to zkBOBPool is directDeposit which allows any external contract to directly deposit BOB to a zkBOB Account with a given zkAddress. So the sender HyperBOB AA wallet doesn‚Äôt have to interact with zkBOB app UI beforehand in which usually they would have to create zkAccount first and deposit BOB to the zkBOBPool.And most importantly all of the complex executions described above is done by sending one transaction while it actually contains multiple transactions in a cross-chain manner such as approve swap bridge and deposit. So from the user‚Äôs point of view it‚Äôs just one click. This is enabled because of the mere fact that the Account Abstraction wallet can execute a batch call and implement arbitrary executions inside.",

    description:
      ' it supports ERC4337 wallet and L1/L2 chainsWe are building a decentralized auction market for ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs. This platform will enable authorized trading listing and order matching for theoretically any digital asset. It supports wallet login with ERC4337 Account Abstract which provides users with the following benefits:Authorization and swap transactions are broadcast simultaneously instead of in two separate steps resulting in a smoother user experience.Stablecoins such as DAI and USDC can be used to pay for gas fees.Powered by Wallet 3 ERC4337 Wallet We are a blockchain company from Japan specializing in creating blockchain wallets.Our flagship product Wallet3 supports all EVM-compatible blockchains including the latest Layer1 Layer2 and zkRollup.We have developed Wallet3 in accordance with the principles of Web3 and have implemented MPC and ERC4337 account abstraction features.For this hackathon we have decided to create a Web3 version of eBaya decentralized auction marketplace.Many ERC20 tokens and NFTs suffer from liquidity issues and this auction system can help solve this problem by bundling tokens together and auctioning them off for instance 10000 units of a less-popular token.Currently our platform supports auctioning ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs but in the future we plan to expand to other types of digital products.We will be showcasing our account abstraction feature from Wallet3 which comes with the added benefit of being able to support gas fees using stablecoins.After authorizing and creating an auction order transaction both transactions will be broadcasted together for a more seamless user experience.Now let\'s walk through a simple operational process:Open the DAPP interface and select "login".Use your pre-prepared Wallet3 ERC4337 wallet account to scan the login code.Let\'s create a new auction.You can choose an ERC20 token enter the contract address the quantity the starting price and the end time.Click "create" authorize the contract to host the tokens in your wallet and then create the auction using USDC to pay for the gas.After the auction is created successfully it will appear on the auction list page with a countdown timer.Click on the auction order and anyone can bid on it.After the auction ends the settlement will occur.During the 36-hour hackathon we wrote the contract code and most of the test cases using Hardhat and developed some front-end pages using the T3 Stack including support for account abstraction wallet login creating auction orders and displaying orders.Due to time constraints there is still a lot of front-end work to be done.After the hackathon we plan to complete all the functionalities and launch it as a new DeFi project.If you are interested in this project or Wallet 3 ERC4337 please contact us as we are looking for partners and investment support.The demonstration above uses the Sepolia testnet.We are currently deploying our DAPP on more networks including Gnosis testnet Scroll AlphaÔºåPoloygon Mumbai and zkEVM testnet and linea testnet.Thank you very much',
