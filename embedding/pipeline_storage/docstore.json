Anyone can develop dApps widgets and place them on the iPhone home screen.\nmerged_column: Widgets Protocol is a revolutionary app that allows Dapps to increase user retention without developing additional apps. With Widgets Protocol,Dapp developers can easily create customizable and interactive widgets that can be embedded within popular social media platforms and other online channels. By doing so,Dapp developers can reach a wider audience,increase user engagement,and ultimately drive more adoption for their decentralized applications. Widgets Protocol is easy to use,flexible,and provides an innovative solution for Dapp developers looking to scale their user base without additional development costs. Try Widgets Protocol today and take your Dapp to the next level! I used SwiftUI throughout the application to provide iOS widgets,and since I did not create any complex screens that required UIKit,I was able to create them using SwiftUI alone.The architecture is based on The Composable Architecture.The application is a hyper-module application,which allows for minimum builds per module and fast development.APIClient is built for each service,which is DI'd by swift-dependency.Since only one widget can be generated per application,we have hacked the system so that a large number of widgets can be created.The application passes the content to be displayed to the widget,and the widget performs UI switching on the widget side,enabling the creation of a large number of widgets.Some sponsors do not provide Public Rest API,so we set up our own Express server to reference data from there.https://github.com/caaaption/WidgetProtocolhttps://github.com/caaaption/WidgetProtocol-api", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "ac482900-2a17-4876-bb2e-5e0bf170ce09": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac482900-2a17-4876-bb2e-5e0bf170ce09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/first_30_rows.csv", "file_name": "first_30_rows.csv", "file_type": "text/csv", "file_size": 50757, "creation_date": "2024-12-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {}, "text": "id: 7\nhackathon: ETHGlobal Tokyo\ntitle: Takarakuji\nlink: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/takarakuji-d1xak\nlive demo: https://ffqns-paaaa-aaaad-qfhna-cai.ic.fleek.co/\nsource code: https://github.com/DAppsNDLT/Takarakuji\nvideo: \nwinner: \ud83d\udcdc Scroll \u2014 Just Deploy \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Polygon \u2014 Pool Prize\nshort: DApp that Let's you play Takarakuji scratch-off online uses ZK rollups\nmerged_column: This DApp uses an L2 to resolve winning tickets and sends them to L1 for the winner to be notified and have crypt paid out to their wallet.

By using modular contracts,developers can save time and reduce complexity when building decentralized applications (DApps) that require multiple contracts.Expanding the utility of DApps across multiple chains is an important goal for many blockchain projects. This is because different blockchain networks have different characteristics,such as scalability,security,and interoperability. By using modular contracts,your project can more easily adapt to these differences and provide a better user experience for your customers.

However as is always the case,nothing is perfect. Every model is biased and it is impossible to build mindblowing models in few hours. Furthermore labeling the data is the most time consuming and often iterative process. Here in this project we deploy the model for both users to explore the ecosystem but also help to better differentiate between the human and bot activities. We store the user contributions on-chain (Scroll Alpha testnet) and paying them the transaction. We think that this provides users incentives to  contribute to the ecosystem as it leaves permanent traces. Furthermore the user inspection is made easier by providing additional Token/NFT data from Ethereum Mainnet that was not used in the training of machine learning.

Why not make it a game? Users can fill slots on a board for 2 minutes and the computer within a semi-random 15 minute interval will select one of those entries on the board to get tokens. I plan to integrate social proof to avoid farming,but for the hackathon sake we make users login to verify their wallet to receive funds and prevent users signing too many times.While many projects attempt to verify security and trust in a multisig and wallet environment,this project turns this concept on its head: what if the wallet itself could do lots of random actions and users with no value in their wallets can submit proposed transactions such as getting some tokens or NFTs. Around every 5 minutes,the server will pick a random square on the proposal grid and execute it through the user's chosen chain and wallet either directly on the chain or via the chain's multisig.The backend here uses gnosis safe SDK and multisigs to collect tokens then a simple forwarder address to submit transactions to the safe.

We achieve this by tracking the inflow and outflow of tokens and using existing rate limiting heuristics to determine if a transaction is a probable hack.

People are fed-up with legacy systems of governance that have ballooned in size and budget to support violent bureaucracies while ignoring pressing problems and crises.  Resources are unfairly distributed,people are sick and hungry,prices are rising,and every day there is a new story detailing some failure of government or outrageous incompetency. It seems that waging war,or threatening to do so,is one of the few things that governments are still able to do.While we continue to innovate in all sectors of the economy while innovation in systems of governance have stalled. We leave governance to more learned,legal minds,and decry the ways government has failed us,without proposing or pursuing change on a more systemic level.Squirrly is an attempt to engage people in a process of governance experimentation by understanding better what it is they think government should actually do,and allowing them to build one from scratch.Users will engage in a generative storytelling game,where decisions are voted on,ideological impact of decisions are logged,and a squirrel government is formed to protect the squirrel nation from global catastrophe,internal strife,and attack by birds to hopefully arrive at ideas for better systems of governance,and more broadly,spark conversation about governance innovation.

I've worked in Healthcare for several years as a service engineer.  All service workers know the pain point in the redundant vendor credentialing process every and throughout the year.  Multiple instances of personal and medical records are created and uploading to various systems in order to receive the credentials to access the hospitals.  This project looks to reduce and/or eliminate the point of creating and uploading multiple instances of private records.  Leveraging ZK technology,only specific information and be shared to the verify instead of a full copy of the record.MINA's protocol makes this project possible to create a project that is able to document any relevant information into a off-chain Merkle Tree process while generating a final proof or the root to be stored on-chain.  The project provides a demo of verifying different pieces of information on a simulated medical record.  The project makes use of the assert methods to verify a proof and also allows for updating records off-chain while only storing minimal data of the root on-chain. This project utilizes MINA protocol starting with it's MINA zkApp CLI.  I started learning how to build with MINA and utilized a boilerplate Merkle Tree sample from the documentation.  MINA uses SnarkyJS which allows to program with Typescript.  A lot of time was spent going through the tutorials of the documentation and there are many improvements that could go along in the future especially utilizing recursion into the program.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "de7a8dfc-4f89-4c20-a8b5-2a5a75e7a2ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "de7a8dfc-4f89-4c20-a8b5-2a5a75e7a2ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/first_30_rows.csv", "file_name": "first_30_rows.csv", "file_type": "text/csv", "file_size": 50757, "creation_date": "2024-12-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {}, "text": "id: 28\nhackathon: ETHGlobal Tokyo\ntitle: Confide.id\nlink: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/confide-id-zj7b8\nlive demo: https://confide.id\nsource code: https://github.com/eli-d/ETHTOKYO2023\nvideo: \nwinner: \ud83c\udf31 NETH \u2014 Ecosystem Impact\nshort: Decentralising community trust. Aiming to solve the problem of digital trust and identification by relying on the most reliable metric: human relationships. Users can validate people they know\nmerged_column: creating a web of trust that can be queried to form new networks and test legitimacy.,This project aims to create a web of trust on chain,where instead of validators or other parties creating universal verification (e.g. verifying to anyone that a given user has a given credential),the trust is personal between people and based on human relationships. A given user is able to say that they trust another in different ways. They can trust the authenticity of another user,that is to declare they are a real person (Proof of Personhood). This may be because they have met them in real life at an event such as a hackathon. They can also trust whether the user is truthful and reliable in their judgement. This may be because they are colleagues or friends and know them to be trustworthy. Trusting a user doesn't create any sort of \"reputation\" or \"vouch\",only posting on chain the fact that I,User A,trust User B to some extent. Once a user has a direct network,they can expand their network of trusted users by looking at the connections of their own connections. For example,if User A trusts User B to be real and trustworthy,and User B does the same for User C,User A can trust that User C is almost definitely real,and can make a judgement about whether they fully or partially trust them (or maybe not at all). The project also facilitates making judgements from combining partial trust - if 3 parties User A believes are real but potentially aren't trustworthy agree that User B is real and completely trustworthy,User A can be sure that User B is almost definitely real,and can again make a judgement about how trustworthy they are. The onchain implementation stores trusted parties for each user in a contract,allowing them to look up and update their trusts.  A webapp allows users to determine whether other users are within a certain degree of trust of their network. For the scope of this hackathon all networks are public,although it could be possible to implement a ZK approach in the future. The frontend uses React/Typescript on Next.js with a bespoke UI component and interaction system. The interface is designed for mobile first. The trust system is stored on chain in a Solidity contract and uses an offchain computation to find paths between users,which are validated on chain before being accepted.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "930ff3e7-5249-46b9-9d8d-4a234228ff6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "930ff3e7-5249-46b9-9d8d-4a234228ff6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/first_30_rows.csv", "file_name": "first_30_rows.csv", "file_type": "text/csv", "file_size": 50757, "creation_date": "2024-12-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {}, "text": "id: 29\nhackathon: ETHGlobal Tokyo\ntitle: H3aven - Gata (Governance for Data)\nlink: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/h3aven-gata-governance-for-data-x94o4\nlive demo: https://melodic-kitsune-ec6b61.netlify.app/\nsource code: https://github.com/H3aven-Labs/h3-gata\nvideo: \nwinner: \ud83d\udcdc Scroll \u2014 Just Deploy \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Polygon \u2014 Pool Prize \ud83e\ude84 FVM \u2014 DataDAOs \ud83e\ude84 Airstack \u2014 \ud83e\udd48 Best Idea Implementation\nshort: Tokenized Access Control Application for Granular Data Governance\nmerged_column: Context:H3aven.com,the leading B2B-Baas of LATAM serves companies by certificating contract and process workflows via corporate blockchain consensus. In ETH Tokyo our goal is to decentralize data storage,so we present GATA: A Data Governance Framework based on Tokenized Organizational Roles.User stories:-> Only a NFT holder is capable of accessing encrypted data.-> All profiles with the same role can access the same data.-> Whenever an user is removed of its role,access to specific data is also atomically removed.Unprecedented Value to Society:Solution to credential double-spending:  It is much more dangerous to share a private-key than to share recoverable credentials (Netflix password).Solution to the corporate data kidnapping problem (Ransomware) by distributing data silos by company roles with complete data redundancy. H3AVEN - GATA uses SAFE'S account abstraction to streamline WEB2 access to WEB3 as well an integration with Gellato a paymaster to outsource fees away from users.For the decentralized storage it uses Filecoin integrated via Lighthouse.

Using lens as the userPlatform,two modules needed to be created,one for accepting a new user and other one to issue the actual SBT.
