The idea is to convince chatGPT it is playing a video game and have its choices reflected in real cryptocurrency buying-selling decisions.The goal was to create a public spectacle of trading with 1% of the funds in the wallet every day going to public goods funding,taking advantage of the (potential) latent trading skill of ChatGPT to fund important infrastructure while simultaneously creating a public spectacle by posting to lens and soliciting trade advice / tips. Unfortunately my laptop internet seemed to stop working entirely so it is largely incomplete :/ This project is written entirely in Python using the Web3 library,with all the RPC requests going through Alchemy and Uniswap for the trades. ChatGPT 3.5 turbo is used for the ai parts,as I do not yet have access to gpt4. I had hoped to add a front end,but the wifi was not quite working so it's extremely incomplete."

Anyone can develop dApps widgets and place them on the iPhone home screen.,"Widgets Protocol is a revolutionary app that allows Dapps to increase user retention without developing additional apps. With Widgets Protocol,Dapp developers can easily create customizable and interactive widgets that can be embedded within popular social media platforms and other online channels. By doing so,Dapp developers can reach a wider audience,increase user engagement,and ultimately drive more adoption for their decentralized applications. Widgets Protocol is easy to use,flexible,and provides an innovative solution for Dapp developers looking to scale their user base without additional development costs. Try Widgets Protocol today and take your Dapp to the next level! I used SwiftUI throughout the application to provide iOS widgets,and since I did not create any complex screens that required UIKit,I was able to create them using SwiftUI alone.The architecture is based on The Composable Architecture.The application is a hyper-module application,which allows for minimum builds per module and fast development.APIClient is built for each service,which is DI'd by swift-dependency.Since only one widget can be generated per application,we have hacked the system so that a large number of widgets can be created.The application passes the content to be displayed to the widget,and the widget performs UI switching on the widget side,enabling the creation of a large number of widgets.Some sponsors do not provide Public Rest API,so we set up our own Express server to reference data from there.https://github.com/caaaption/WidgetProtocolhttps://github.com/caaaption/WidgetProtocol-api"

By using modular contracts,developers can save time and reduce complexity when building decentralized applications (DApps) that require multiple contracts.Expanding the utility of DApps across multiple chains is an important goal for many blockchain projects. This is because different blockchain networks have different characteristics,such as scalability,security,and interoperability. By using modular contracts,your project can more easily adapt to these differences and provide a better user experience for your customers. Project Utilizes Connext,1Inch,Polygon,Polygon zkEVM,Gnosis,SAFE.Connext is a cross-chain bridge with trust-minimized solution,which allows for fast,cheap,and secure transfers to multiple domains. 1Inch is a decentralized exchange aggregator,which allows users to find the best prices for trading tokens across various DEXs. Polygon (previously known as Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum,which aims to improve the scalability and usability of the Ethereum network. Polygon zkEVM is a version of Polygon that uses zero-knowledge proofs to improve scalability even further.

This project is the final result of on-chain exploration of the Fusion Swap mechanism and resolvers. To avoid using overly dirty scrapping methods in this hackathon,we query the data via Etherscan's API. Etherscan had the data more intuitively structured for this analysis than Dune,hence this choice.Information on the ERC20 tokens and their prices was also needed,so the DeFillama historical price api was also used,especially since it supports queries via the ERC20 token address,while providing us with all the metadata like decimals,symbol,etc,hence avoiding direct eth_calls or contract calls in this poor WiFi hackathon environment."
10,ETHGlobal Tokyo,Bot or Not,https://ethglobal.com/showcase/bot-or-not-oox84,,https://github.com/kkpsiren/lens-bot-or-not,,📜 Scroll — Just Deploy,Bots are taking over the world and are dangerooooous. It is up to us the users the start contributing to fight against them. Let's go. Be the superhero. Earn blockchain cred by executing your insights on-chain.,"Using data analysis we first train a machine learning model to uncover the some insight into the bot activity on Lens Protocol by generating a publicly available dataset of over 100k profiles. However as is always the case,nothing is perfect. Every model is biased and it is impossible to build mindblowing models in few hours. Furthermore labeling the data is the most time consuming and often iterative process. Here in this project we deploy the model for both users to explore the ecosystem but also help to better differentiate between the human and bot activities. We store the user contributions on-chain (Scroll Alpha testnet) and paying them the transaction. We think that this provides users incentives to  contribute to the ecosystem as it leaves permanent traces. Furthermore the user inspection is made easier by providing additional Token/NFT data from Ethereum Mainnet that was not used in the training of machine learning. This is done with the incredible support Airstack. This solo hacked project combined data analytics (scraping like hell for Lens Protocol + onchain data). ML/AI using Google tabnet semisupervised learning (oldie but goldie) for bot classification. Gaming UI to incentivize people to contribute to labeling data and potentially validating the results. New GraphQL checking with Airstack. Cool resource and especially GPT4 plugin to write faster queries. Although complex queries still need some work. Fast data offers lot of interesting possibilities! Here we use it as a tool to assist analytics. Deploying attestations of user contributions to Optimism AttestationStation contract that this project deployed to Scroll. Besides these.  By far the biggest resource that was hacked was Lens Protocol. Flipside Crypto was used for additional analytics.

The questions are preparation for the initial interviews for the Graph Advocates program.,"A web-based quiz platform that uses Celo blockchain technology for a transparent,tamper-proof,and decentralized experience. Users connect their Celo wallet to register,answer questions,and receive rewards in Celo tokens. The platform leverages smart contracts for quiz logic and ensures data integrity,making it ideal for educational or competitive purposes. The user-friendly interface and integration with popular wallet providers offer a seamless experience,while the underlying blockchain technology fosters trust and fairness for all participants. I used ChatGPT to write all the code,as I do not have any coding experience. It was very interesting to see how good it was!ChatGPT used: To build this web-based quiz platform,we utilized the following technologies:Celo Blockchain: The core of the project,Celo provides a decentralized,secure,and transparent system. We used Celo's smart contracts to handle quiz logic,user registration,and token rewards. This ensures data integrity and maintains trust among participants.Solidity: We wrote smart contracts in Solidity,the primary language for Ethereum and Celo blockchain development. These contracts handle quiz creation,question management,user participation,and rewards distribution.React: A popular JavaScript library,React enabled us to build a responsive and interactive user interface. We integrated it with Web3.js to communicate with the Celo blockchain.Web3.js: This library allowed us to interact with the Celo blockchain,enabling users to connect their wallets,participate in quizzes,and receive rewards.Node.js & Express: We used Node.js for server-side logic,and Express to create a lightweight,flexible API to serve quiz content,user data,and other necessary information.One notable hacky aspect of our project was the implementation of a custom gas optimization technique. We minimized the amount of data stored on-chain by keeping quiz content off-chain and only storing necessary transactional data. This significantly reduced gas fees and improved user experience without compromising data integrity or decentralization."

13,ETHGlobal Tokyo,Chaos Distribute,https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chaos-distribute-vdxzj,https://chaos-distribute.vercel.app/,https://github.com/iainnash/chaos-distribute,,🏊‍♂️ Polygon — Pool Prize,Chaotically distribute NFTs,"Tokens across many chains in a dice/array format where users submit their desires into each slot and the server chooses a slot every 15ish minutes,Getting testnet and real tokens to use without any introduction to crypto is a race sometimes – for only small amounts of tokens. Why not make it a game? Users can fill slots on a board for 2 minutes and the computer within a semi-random 15 minute interval will select one of those entries on the board to get tokens. I plan to integrate social proof to avoid farming,but for the hackathon sake we make users login to verify their wallet to receive funds and prevent users signing too many times.While many projects attempt to verify security and trust in a multisig and wallet environment,this project turns this concept on its head: what if the wallet itself could do lots of random actions and users with no value in their wallets can submit proposed transactions such as getting some tokens or NFTs. Around every 5 minutes,the server will pick a random square on the proposal grid and execute it through the user's chosen chain and wallet either directly on the chain or via the chain's multisig.The backend here uses gnosis safe SDK and multisigs to collect tokens then a simple forwarder address to submit transactions to the safe. If something happens to the forwarder,assets are safe and can be recovered from another address associated with the safe to remove the forwarder's permission and fix the issues.Supported chains:Mumbai / PolygonGoerli / ETHGnosis ChainMantle This project uses a standard web front-end interface. Originally,I wanted the wallets not to be virtual multisigs but instead owned by users and able to do any action.

We achieve this by tracking the inflow and outflow of tokens and using existing rate limiting heuristics to determine if a transaction is a probable hack. This smart contract acts like a proxy between the defi protocol and the broader chain. Using this proxy,we can determine if a token outflow is a likely hack. For example in the euler hack,99% of the TVL disappeared in a few blocks,this is something we can surely detect using smart contracts. Additionally,we created a web app to monitor the inflow and outflows as well as some quick actions for the admin in the even of a hack.We leverage push notifications to quickly notify the relevant parties."

Developer Community as a Service exists to make it easier to multiply the output of Developer relations teams. Our lens-powered,stack overflow meets message board,allows for developers to build and share their code in a social setting and receive help from the Protocols and developer communities they are building with.We aim to help foster the growth of developer communities in two ways:Create a platform where insights and code snippets shared in the walled gardens of Discord and telegram can be saved for future reference and discoverability.A Telegram bot that is trained on protocol documentation and on community-supplied questions to help point builders in the right direction as they navigate new technologies.Our smart contracts track comments,messages,and associated authors based on a lens profile. We took this approach to make our platform cross-chain from the start and have deployed on Polygon,Linea,and Scroll.Moving forward,we plan to implement lens posts on the Polygon communities and explore ways this can be extended further. This project uses the Lens Protocol API to authenticate and to create developer user accounts. Our smart contracts were built with hardhat and deployed on Polygon,Linea,and Scroll.Additionally,we leveraged the Telegram Bot API as well as Open AI's Chat GPT Fine Tuning API to create a proof of concept bot that can be trained on developers questions and the best answers supplied to those questions. Over time the bot will be better trained and equipped to handle many inquiries."

People are fed-up with legacy systems of governance that have ballooned in size and budget to support violent bureaucracies while ignoring pressing problems and crises.  Resources are unfairly distributed,people are sick and hungry,prices are rising,and every day there is a new story detailing some failure of government or outrageous incompetency. It seems that waging war,or threatening to do so,is one of the few things that governments are still able to do.While we continue to innovate in all sectors of the economy while innovation in systems of governance have stalled. We leave governance to more learned,legal minds,and decry the ways government has failed us,without proposing or pursuing change on a more systemic level.Squirrly is an attempt to engage people in a process of governance experimentation by understanding better what it is they think government should actually do,and allowing them to build one from scratch.Users will engage in a generative storytelling game,where decisions are voted on,ideological impact of decisions are logged,and a squirrel government is formed to protect the squirrel nation from global catastrophe,internal strife,and attack by birds to hopefully arrive at ideas for better systems of governance,and more broadly,spark conversation about governance innovation. A conversation we desperately need to have if we are to survive all the natural and unnatural horrors that will confront us as we move forward in time. I was working on the scenario generation engine for this hackathon. With the help of my brother,we built a querying and classification engine using the OpenAI API and langchain to string together prompts and produce a data object that can be written to chain and pushed to users on a daily basis."

Traditionally,Superfluid money stream is controlled by ACL(Access Control List),which we have to trust those listed entities(wallet addresses).In our platform:In given DAOs(e.g. BuidlGuidl),contributors are working with hourly-based fee. (e.g. $20/hour,over next 3 months)Contributors have to submit his progress within a certain interval(e.g. daily,weekly) publicly open.Contributors get paid with Superfluid money stream from DAO Treasury.Other community members continuously check his work provided step2.To create/update/delete the money stream,the corresponding statement of UMA oracle must be settled and “true”. For example,to delete the money stream,someone in the community claims that “A has stopped working(no recent progress submission) anymore” and is settled as a true statement through UMA. This project uses @superfluid for streaming payments to builders based realtime,we are using @uma oracle to decentralize/democratize control of Superfluid money stream by UMA’s optimistic oracle. Money flow control of Superfluid and UMA’s attestation is integrated on smart contract level.We have used @worldcoin id for human verification before setting up stream for the builder. The platform uses @push chat for better community engagement,and it's also deployed to @polygonMumbai."

I've worked in Healthcare for several years as a service engineer.  All service workers know the pain point in the redundant vendor credentialing process every and throughout the year.  Multiple instances of personal and medical records are created and uploading to various systems in order to receive the credentials to access the hospitals.  This project looks to reduce and/or eliminate the point of creating and uploading multiple instances of private records.  Leveraging ZK technology,only specific information and be shared to the verify instead of a full copy of the record.MINA's protocol makes this project possible to create a project that is able to document any relevant information into a off-chain Merkle Tree process while generating a final proof or the root to be stored on-chain.  The project provides a demo of verifying different pieces of information on a simulated medical record.  The project makes use of the assert methods to verify a proof and also allows for updating records off-chain while only storing minimal data of the root on-chain. This project utilizes MINA protocol starting with it's MINA zkApp CLI.  I started learning how to build with MINA and utilized a boilerplate Merkle Tree sample from the documentation.  MINA uses SnarkyJS which allows to program with Typescript.  A lot of time was spent going through the tutorials of the documentation and there are many improvements that could go along in the future especially utilizing recursion into the program."

Aiming to solve the problem of digital trust and identification by relying on the most reliable metric: human relationships. Users can validate people they know,"creating a web of trust that can be queried to form new networks and test legitimacy.,This project aims to create a web of trust on chain,where instead of validators or other parties creating universal verification (e.g. verifying to anyone that a given user has a given credential),the trust is personal between people and based on human relationships. A given user is able to say that they trust another in different ways. They can trust the authenticity of another user,that is to declare they are a real person (Proof of Personhood). This may be because they have met them in real life at an event such as a hackathon. They can also trust whether the user is truthful and reliable in their judgement. This may be because they are colleagues or friends and know them to be trustworthy. Trusting a user doesn't create any sort of ""reputation"" or ""vouch"",only posting on chain the fact that I,User A,trust User B to some extent. Once a user has a direct network,they can expand their network of trusted users by looking at the connections of their own connections. For example,if User A trusts User B to be real and trustworthy,and User B does the same for User C,User A can trust that User C is almost definitely real,and can make a judgement about whether they fully or partially trust them (or maybe not at all). The project also facilitates making judgements from combining partial trust - if 3 parties User A believes are real but potentially aren't trustworthy agree that User B is real and completely trustworthy,User A can be sure that User B is almost definitely real,and can again make a judgement about how trustworthy they are. The onchain implementation stores trusted parties for each user in a contract,allowing them to look up and update their trusts.  A webapp allows users to determine whether other users are within a certain degree of trust of their network. For the scope of this hackathon all networks are public,although it could be possible to implement a ZK approach in the future. The frontend uses React/Typescript on Next.js with a bespoke UI component and interaction system. The interface is designed for mobile first. The trust system is stored on chain in a Solidity contract and uses an offchain computation to find paths between users,which are validated on chain before being accepted."
